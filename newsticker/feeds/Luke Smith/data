<p>An Arch update to <code>ttf-inconsolata</code> has temporarily broken the font.
If you're a member of an Arch forum or IRC, I recommend notifying them/the developer of this.
I don't have an account there.</p>

<p>
Since Inconsolata is the default monospace in LARBS, I've been getting a lot of emails as to how to fix or patch this.
Just change your default monospace font in <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> to another install monospace font.
If you don't know what monospace fonts you have installed, list them with <code>fc-list | grep -i mono</code>.
See our Github issue.

<p>I'll probably record a video on this tomorrow, but I might as well ask my blog audience first, <b>What should be the default web browser in LARBS?</b></p>

<p>Right now it's Brave, since that's what I do and it comes with a lot of features I consider basic already built in.
The problem with nearly all web browsers is that it's pretty hard and annoying to put together \"dotfiles\" for them, a default profile that has sensible defaults.
</p>

<p>
Brave is especially nice because it comes with add-ons that block adds, redirect to HTTPS and add Tor and torrenting capabilities.
But while sometimes Brave will prompt the user on first run for their preferred start engine, on some systems after running LARBS, it will just assume Google, which I absolutely want to avoid.
</p>

<p>I'm sure you all have the agency to change your search engine to something more sensible, most use DuckduckGo (I prefer Searx), but when it comes to the default, the sileny majority is going to continue with the default idly, and I don't want to set them on the wrong path.
Why even use Linux if you're just going to send everything straight to Google anyways?
</p>

<h2>Possible browsers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Brave &ndash; Again, great defaults, but Google might end up as the default search engine.</li>
<li>Ungoogled-chromium &ndash; Possibly the safest bet, no cringe branding or bad policies, but it doesn't look like it has any search engine by default... That will be a big annoyance to novices.</li>
<li>Palemoon &ndash; Manjaro i3 uses it, fast, good-looking, but it has an incestuous development team which has made... odd choices (`~/.moonchild productions/` makes me want to kms whenever I `ls -a`), but okay on privacy (weird startup screen, but could be worse). Bad/limited add-ons/extensions.</li>
<li>Icecat &ndash; I'll admit it, two years, Icecat was absolutely unusable on pretty much all sites, but it looks like it's evened most everything out. Probably the best browser for raw privacy, but still probably the least usable since users have to keep in mind if they need to turn some script blocker off for a site, etc.</li>
<li>qutebrowser &ndash; I haven't used it in years and I don't know if I want to get back into figuring it out for the third time, lol. I don't know where it is nowadays, but if I'm making normies use it, it's going to have to be able to play YouTube videos and without 400% CPU usage. qutebrowser does have the _massive_ advantage of __actually having dotfiles__ so I can easily change defaults.</li>
<li>Waterfox &ndash; Well, a better form of Firefox on most fronts, but Bing is the default search engine.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Premptive 'no' to the following</h2>
<ul>
<li>surf &ndash; Too much work for an individual, let alone managing one build to rule them all. There are cool suckless things you can do with it, but it's also just slow.</li>
<li>Browsers I'm not familiar with (uzbl, luakit). I hear they're really cool, but for me to install it on other peoples' computers, I need to be organicly familiar with it. You'd have to convince me to use them individually first.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll also say, and I had never heard this take until I did my video on Brave, I obviously have no qualms about using a chromium-based browser. Apparently there are people out there who have the idea that source code is just magically evil if it was written by Google, even if it is 100% free and open source and well-audited.

<p>Suckless software has long been burdened by a peculiar error that causes crashes whenever trying to load a colored emoji.
This has meant extreme annoyance for me and confusion for people who use my dotfiles.
The only band-aid for this error has been just installing a font with good unicode coverage and hoping that monospace fonts dare not to print out colored emojis, and making a fontconfig that keeps it that way.</p>

<p>Recently, however, a fix has been posted to the AUR in the <code>libxft-bgra</code> package, which will hopefully become part of the Xft upstream soon.
This will avoid the error, and allows unpatched st to view colored emojis without a problem.</p>

<p>I do a video on this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9qNXV01yzg\">here</a>.</p>

<p>For those who use my dotfiles, update <em>everything</em>: the st build, the dwmblocks build if you use it, the dotfiles, etc. and install <code>libxft-bgra</code>.
I had variously patched software to avoid these problems, but those patches have now been reverted to allow color emojis if you want them.</p>

<p>Well my anprim internet just ruined another upload of a 3GB video... ;-) So I might as well give this little update to RSS/blog followers before I'm able to upload vids from a more stable location.</p>

<p>As I've said before, I saw thinking of making LARBS compatible with both i3-gaps and dwm.
Both of them have their advantages: i3 is much more easy for newbs (and non-newbs, and non-weebs for that matter) to customize, while dwm's master and slave layout is pretty hard for me to give up despite the fact that its default statusbar is atrocious and comes with the non-unfounded fragility of some suckless applications.</p>

<p>On a whim, I decided to play around with bspwm over this weekend, and I've got to say that it has a lot of both... or really, it is so customizable that it can be extended to both.</p>

<p>
If you don't know anything about bspwm,
I'll direct you to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLZbk1-wwVA\">a video by Wolfgang on bspwm, specifically comparing it with i3</a>
(Although my informants tell me he is a GNOME-cuck or something nowadays or something ;-)&mdash;maybe I should try that?)
</p>

<p>bspwm, unlike i3 and dwm is just a raw window manager (WM): it does not even have a unique status bar or keybinding system: you are expected to use a modular bar of your own choosing and a binding program like sxhkd to map what you need.</p>

<p>My setup is modular enough, in that I already have sxhkd for most my binds, including many scripts and even statusbar scripts that the change-over has been pretty quick.
If I feel like bspwm is more stable and can get everything I want from i3 and everything I want for dwm, I might use it for good.
</p>

<p>I've also dusted off the old polybar config, which I had barely modified before... and I've begun to add new modules, like those I made for i3blocks (which again is a pretty simple process due to the modularity of both).
People always liked polybar more and many have been asking for it back, despite the fact that I did a post earlier this year or so on why I had stopped using it for LARBS' sake.</p>

This is especially a problem because if unicode characters aren't rendering correctly, st especially has a tendency to crash when rendering them.
If you install LARBS, run into this kind of problem and want to fix it, you'll have to find an alternative font yourself until I get the chance to find a permanent solution.</p>

<p>As I said in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWpf4ZSAHBo\">my most recent video several days ago</a>, I am moving (and now am completing moving) into a very rural place to a house/putative homestead which has due to memes been colloquially referred to as \"the Unaboomer's Cabin\". As I always say, it's not a cabin, but a full house, but this does mean pretty significant lifestyle changes for me and a new page for the channel as well. As I said in the video, I might not be able to easily upload videos for a short while until I get settled, but here are some updates:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I've moved my stuff to the house and am now going through a life's worth of papers, tools, books, furniture and everything else trying to decorate my house. In addition to my own stuff, there's a lot of furniture and other accouterments that came with the house and there is even more that my dad has been keeping in a nearby shed for extra storage. I'm collocating and organizing all of this</li>
	<li>I have more room than I've ever had, as you would hope. I have three (or depending on how you count four) bedrooms, one of which I'll be using as an office/studio. It will be nice for insomnia's sake to keep my electronics (which are internetless anyway) away from being a distraction in bed!</li>
	<li>I also have lots of land that I need to fully assess. My relative who lived here before didn't have so much of a garden, but did plant and maintain several useful plants (although some I don't even know!). There are definitely unattended grape plants/vines and some fruit-bearing trees.?</li>
	<li>It will be a day or two more before I'm done sorting all my stuff indoors and in the garage/workshop, but after that, the priority is making a garden. Many, including many of you suggested using raised beds, and I think I've decided to try them. It might be late to plant some things, but the growing season this far south is long, so I'll be consulting with some of my growing guides and people around for best practices.</li>
	<li>My internet is truly bad! I haven't even tried to upload videos yet, but text-based and (small) image based browsing is okay. Videos will buffer and will take a bit with youtube-dl. Luckily, I've designed my computer usage over minimizing bandwidth use for a day like this, but I still need to upload videos. I'll figure out the best way to do this soon. I also am going to need to get into the crawlspace to run an ethernet cord to my new office.</li>
	<li>I get no cell service in my house, and am further thinking of getting rid of my cell phone forever. There are other providers with better coverage here though, but I think I might go max-Boomer and just get a landline which obviously is infinitely more reliable.</li>
	<li>It was sad leaving my friends in Statesboro, but I will be going back at some point soon (there of course are things I left behind ;-) and other chores to do). It is nice all the things I do avoid here: like Zoomers blasting that Kanye/Lil Pump song every night at the club across the street. Won't miss that.</p>

<p>I'm making significant changes to my dotfiles repos and LARBS, so I wanted to give people a heads up about it.
It's possible (probable?) that there will be some breakage (now and soon) because there are a lot of moving pieces that have moved around.
Here are the changes coming soon:</p>

<ul>
	<li>There will be a new version of LARBS, which will eventually be the default if everything works smoothly.
		I will maintain the current version for Arch Linux using i3-gaps, but I will be adding another version for <strong>Void Linux that runs dwm</strong>.
	</li>
	<li>Reflecting some of the movements to mutal compatibility I moved keybinds from the main i3 config to <code>~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc</code> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ClckQzJTlk\">as I discussed in my video today</a>) and moved some startup scripts to <code>~/.xinitrc</code>.</li>
	<li><code>~/.scripts/</code> in the repo is now <code>~/.local/bin/</code> to be XDG compliant and save you one extra element in your home directory.</li>
	<li>I've moved things around in <a href=\"https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/larbs\">the LARBS repository</a> as well, and this could interfere with the <a href=\"https://larbs.xyz\">LARBS website</a> and how it redirects requests, but everything seems to be in order.</li>
</ul>

<p>So every one of these developments bode well, but all can cause temporary breakage!
If you run into a problem install LARBS, you will not be bothering me to email it to me.
I would appreciate people to test it if you have a spare machine/VM as well, but I'm a little burdened right now.
I'll be testing in a bit.</p>

<p>Note that the Void Linux/dwm version of LARBS is not supposed to be working yet. I'm still on the basic level with that. The Arch/i3 version hopefully should be still fine though.</p>

<p>
The thing is, there are a lot of ins-and-outs and details that I just don't know about growing a garden: what is best to plant when, what plants reinforce others, how long does a plant take to get to maturity.
I'd like a physical book reference with all the major details for growing the most common fruits and vegetables, possibly along with other information that I don't even know that I don't know.

<p>Instead of being an interactive loop, it's now a command you run like this: <code>mw init</code> once to initialize the files, then <code>mw add</code> to add an email account, etc. etc. That official mutt-wizard script, <code>mw</code>, is installed in your path now, along with <code>mailsync</code> allowing you to easily run them wherever and treat them like noraml programs.</p>

<p>Also, the template muttrc, mailcap and the domains.csv are held in <code>/usr/share/mutt-wizard</code> so you don't have to worry about them cluttering your personal mutt folder proper.</p>

<p>Some of you had already tried out the new version of mutt-wizard on Gitlab, but I've now <a href=\"https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard\" target=\"_blank\">release it on the Github repository as well</a>. mutt-wizard has always be able to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Access your mail on the command line without having to set anything up. It looks pretty and has sensible default settings.</li>
	<li>Optionally download, store and sync your email offline, so you can browse your email with no latency and read and write replies while offline.</li>
	<li>Securely encrypt all your passwords with GPG so you don't have dangerous plaintext floating around or to avoid typing your passwords in constantly.</li>
	<li>Configs for neomutt, isync and msmtp automatically generated based on your server settings, which in many cases, mutt-wizard already knows.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of the biggest changes in mutt-wizard that make it much better now:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The original mutt-wizard required three annoying steps for each account: (1) data input, then (2) the user manually running offlineimap and then (3) running the script again to finalize boxes. Wow that was dumb. <b>isync now enables all the configuration to happen in one quick sitting as fast as you can type your info in.</b></li>
	<li>You now have the option of <strong>not</strong> keeping mail offline, in case you don't want that.</li>
	<li>Passwords are now saved with <code>pass</code>, which avoids some headaches.</li>
	<li><code>dialog</code> is no longer used as user-interface.</li>
	<li>More error handling, but also less errors.</li>

In the future, I might switch to one of these if I can get them to do everything I need, but if I do, everything on Patreon will carry over, so don't sweat it.

<p>I'm going to start giving perks, extra videos, personal vlogs and reviews and Mumble server access to people who support me monetarily.
I do have <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/lukesmith\" target=\"_blank\">a Patreon</a>, which you can support me on, but I've never really done much more than start one, only posted for a brief period and just sort not delete it.
I've never made a fuss about it and I've been at the same level of support for more than a year which is basically just some monthy groecery income, which is nice, but I'd like to start earning more and I have some stuff to offer now.
Obviously I'm not a big fan of Patreon's past behavior, I will use them if needbe, but I was curious about a server-side equivalent.
</p>

<p>
I'd like this: a service I can host on my own website that allows users to log in and will verify that they've donated X ammount in the last month by Zelle or Paypal or whatever.
If so, it will give them access to extra content.
As far as I'm concerned, this would be <em>better</em> than Patreon just because it cuts out the Middle Man.
</p>

<p>It isn't too difficult to make password-protected content on a webserver, nor is it too hard to create usernames and passwords for people.
I'm more thinking of if there is a service that can verify a payment.

<p>If there's nothing quite like this and I can't come across a quick way to do it myself, I'll just end up using Patreon.</p>

<p>As <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://notrelated.xyz\">Not Related!</a></em> fans will know well, I haven't made an episode in several months!
This is for a variety of reasons, but I've decided to switch it up for an episode tomorrow by recording LIVE, streaming on YouTube.
</p>

<p>The link will be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IP5FrJghk8\">HERE</a>. The chatroom will be open until then. I might stop in every so often in the wait.
I've scheduled it for 2PM New York time tomorrow, but I <em>might</em> change that by an hour or two if I need to. Check back at that link for updates.
</p>

<p>Here's how it's going to work:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Not Related!</em> episodes I typical arrange as 30 minutes of depthy content, followed by a brief break and donation reading, followed by another 30 minutes of content. The beginning of the stream will work like this.</li>
	<li>The podcast is still audio and will still be released as such. I might occasionally use a minor visual aid, but nothing that will make consuming the content via audio diminished. I'll probably just have the topic and a webcam in the video.</li>
	<li>Chat will be live, but I will not be actively reading it until the break and it will not appear on the video (it will, as all YouTube streams, appear on the edge).</li>
	<li>Related/serious donation will be answered in that in-between break time. Non-serious/meme/joke or just unrelated donations will be answered at the very end (this will not be included in the audio version of the podcast, unless I deem it high-quality discussion).</li>
</ul>

<p>In this arrangement, we can have all the typical glory of a <em>Not Related!</em> episode while still \"devolving\" into a general purpose stream as time goes on. Obviously it can be interactive at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>The starting topic of the episode/stream:</strong></p>

<p>This episode/stream will be on the absolute(ly terrible) state of \"statistics\" as it is used in the \"soft\" sciences: psychology, neuroscience, medicine, econometrics, here in linguistics and many others.
All of these disciplines are in hot water.
A lot of people are aware that there is flimsy knowledge of statistics in a lot of non-specialist fields, but in this episode, I go to an even deeper problem: the \"Null Ritual\" (Gerd Gigerenzer's term), a statistical analysis procedure that is essentially required for publication, but is also a historical misunderstanding and mistake that has produced entire fields of people running statistical tests of unclear scientific and epistemological meaning, while also abiding by totally arbitrary conventions (p &lt; 0.05 and more).
</p>

<p>
I'll go into the original history of modern statistics, as expounded by Ronald Fisher and his \"adversaries\" Neyman and Pearson.
Their competing theories were motivated in entirely different ways, but have been distorted and confused over the decades, resulting in the hybridized \"null ritual\" we see today.
</p>

<p>I'll also talk about how this contributed to the \"replication problem\", reminding one of Ioannidis's now well-known 2005 paper: \"Why Most Published Research Findings Are False.\"</p>

<p><b>Do not read Wikipedia or even a textbook on anything related to this before the podcast! You will be misinformed!</b> Refer to Gigerenzer's 2004 article \"Mindless Statistics\" and the ensuing literature, but I should say that there is a very big gap between this specialist literature and the mostly cargo-cult understanding of the statistical methods that filter into textbooks and then into public repositories like Wikipedia, etc. This is why I think this topic is highly important to get out there!</p>

<p>I usually abstain from using the mouse, but I've noticed a lot of interest in <em>plumbing</em> recently, and have got a lot of emails about it.
Plan 9 is a highly unique operating system, integrating the mouse directly into the most basic UI, and the right click importantly can \"plumb\" selected text.
This can mean various things from opening or running the file corresponding to the text or something else, but as a design feature, plumbing is something worth playing around with on other operating systems.

Of course, this kind of plumbing is piecemeal compared to the Plan 9 orignal: it really is a kind of text handler mediated by dmenu, but it gets at part of the functionality.

One of the weird things that has happened since I <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PBqpX0_UOc\">put out my video on installing Arch Linux</a> and since I release <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://larbs.xyz\">LARBS</a> is that I get a lot of people who install Arch and LARBS without knowing anything about it!
I suppose that's a good thing, but I've begun to get very basic questions from people who don't know the absolute basics of pacman.
</p>

<p>The video above is a response to this.
It covers installing, updating, searching for, listing and manpulating packages and other pacman settings, some of which maybe even veteran users might not be familiar with.

It's not just about lines of code or dependencies, but about potentiality for breakage and frustration.

Nowadays, the standard modus operandi for many \"\"\"devs\"\"\" is to write programs to substrate over previous ones.
Sounds sensible, but when everyone is doing it, we have nothing but an ever increasing mound of mutually-dependent programs for which even the most minor error can cause everything to come crashing down.

<p>I got an email this morning from a subscriber asking about command-line tools for Biblical textual criticism/study, specifically in Greek or Hebrew.
Most of you know I'm terrible with email due to the sheer quantity I get, but for whatever reason, I saw this and was a little inspired to actually work it out.
</p>

<p>
Before this morning are were some good English tools, like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/bontibon/kjv\">this one on Github</a> (<code>kjv-git</code> in the AUR), but no to my knowledge, nothing really in the original language.
<code>kjv-git</code> can return any (English) King James Version Bible verse, series of verses or whole book at your command, but there is no obvious equivalent in Greek or Hebrew.
This is an annoyance because for anyone like me who occasionally needs a Bible verse or the original wording of a passage, you have to open up a browser and search for it in a bloated website written by a Soydev.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, this morning since I was skipping church for highly justified reasons, I forked the repository and painstakingly found and rearranged a plaintext Greek Septuagint (i.e. the Old Testament) and the SBL Greek New Testament so that they could be read by the same system.
Took a lot of regexing, but you can get it for yourself here: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/grb\">https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/grb</a>.
Many Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical books are included if you like the Bible: Expanded Universe.

<p>I'll probably eventually record a video on it, but I'm travelling and didn't bring by mic/webcam to record, so I might do it next week.
Before then, I recommend you check it out and find any glitches if there are any.

That opens up a world of possibilities, so I show some of my minor implementations in the video.

<p>Really the deeper point I was making was the non-arbitrariness of identity.
There are now forces overwhelming in society pushing people to disconnect from and reject their families, religions, traditions, culture and even their countries.
</p>

<p>
One of the falsest notions now common in modernity is the idea that \"identity\" is something chosen by unaffected personal whim.
To the Bugman, \"identity\" is something chosen like a favorite color, and it offends their programmed ego to be told that they were born how and where and in the social context that they were, and all of that is immutable.
</p>

<p>In reality, an \"identity\" that is chosen is not an identity at all, but a coping mechanism for those people who have lost touch.</p>

<p>Today was my first full day of my weeklong outing, and I spent a lot of the time walking through the pines and on firelanes.
I went to visit some family land by the river, which had been partially flooded with some residual marshland.
There's a non-negligible chance that in the future I might be building a house on that parcel, albeit much further away from the river for fear of the occasional hurricane-based flooding.
</p>

<p>I also visited the church cemetary where many of my ancestors are buried.</p>

<p>I did have the chance to record some material for videos, but I won't be able to upload it until I either get back or drive quite a while to get to an area with public internet.
Out here, the main way people even have an internet connection is via satillite.
Dial-up was common relatively recently.
</p>

<p>
I didn't mention it yesterday, but the \"urbanization\" of the area is somewhat jarring.
I mean \"urbanization\" in the loosest sense (I'm not quite sure what to call it, perhaps \"commercialization\"), but a lot of the small towns in the area have started to produce Subways, McDonalds, chain gas stations and even a couple of Walmarts.
The essence of the area hasn't changed that much, but it could mean the beginning of a potentially irreversable process.
Still, where I am is imminently rural, without the hint of even a non-chain restaurant or a grocery store for miles and miles.
</p>

<p>
When I was young, my grandfather used to arrange for gasoline to be shipped to a tank on our property, but that was a long time ago.
If you wanted to go \"shopping\", you'd have to drive more than an hour to get to Valdosta, which in the grand scheme of things is still a relatively small college town, although I much confess that that city has balooned in size and business in the 10 years since I did my first year of college there in 2008-2009.

<p>As I mentioned in my last livestream, I'm spending this coming week in a remote, undiscolsed location with minimal internet connection.
Earlier today I was Booming as usual back home, but I took a long drive to a family area several hundred miles away where I'll probably be for the next week.
If you're reading this on or shortly after the 15th, it means I at least had the cell service to update the blog, but don't expect any videos this week (although I will be recording some for later release).
</p>

<p>
I decided to leave town because I can, and  because I'd like to have free time to work on whatever strikes me.
I always recommend building a \"schedule\" which is purposefully mostly empty: only then can you truly end up doing what matters.
Perhaps I'll make some videos or record podcasts or work on my dissertations.
We'll see.
</p>

<p>
You often forget, even when you live in a pretty small city what exactly true silence sounds like.
Back where I live now, there is still the constant nightly buzz of Zoomers at the club listening to that damned Kanye/Lil Pump song 6 million times a night.
Here during nightime, however, at first you hear nothing, and only after long exposure do you hear the distant packs of wolves and wild dogs howling at each other, or the bleating of a boar.
When in non-rural areas usually most of what you hear is drowned out as the unimportant mess it is, if you go for a midnight stroll in a dark forest, every sound becomes meaningful, if not alarming. Even as I write this on the porch of the isolated house, a larger animal is rummaging gently in the bush just out of my field of view.
I'm a little unnerved as it seems to be working its way slowly to me, perhaps trying to figure out the clacking of a ThinkPad keyboard and the brightness of the accompanying ThinkLight.
</p>

<p>
I thought about soiling an earlier night walk by recording a video, but while your eyes adjust to the only light, the moon, a cell phone can hardly make the adjustment and capture the actual appearance of anything, not least by blaring its electronic luminescene on everything.
Anyway, I'm going to try to upload at least this post and turn of what remaining electronics I have here.

<p>I was playing around with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug\">ueberzug</a>, which is a possbly more consistent replacement for the w3m image preview.
Give it an images and a location/dimensions for it and it will print it to the terminal.
The preview will survive after multiple resizing, mouse away and anything else.
Much more robust than w3mimg.
</p>

<p>A brief example in bash. I recommend installing ueberzug via pip to ensure all the right dependencies.</p>

<pre><code>source \"`ueberzug library`\"
ImageLayer
declare -A command=([path]=\"pix/image.png\" [identifier]=\"name\" [action]=\"add\" [x]=\"0\" [y]=\"0\" [max_width]=\"400\" [height]=\"400\")</code></pre>

<p>The above will print <code>pix/image.png</code> in the top left (0x0) and ensure it fits within 400x400 by resizing it.
If you spawn a bunch more windows and move it around, the image is very consistent.
</p>

<p>Now vifm does provide some built-in arguments for the size of the preview window and location, but despite a little tinkering, I couldn't actually get any previews to pop up.
I tried in my build of st, urxvt and alacritty and none worked in vifm.
</p>

<p>
I could toy around with it a little more and figure it out, but if any of you guys have already done it, feel free to share your script/command to do it.
Ideally I'd like vifm previews, but also an independent script that could simply print out an image argument to the command line.

I say this because if I use or bring up Namecheap (my VPS host) as an example in the video, that will probably bring new users/customers to them.

<p>I just released a video talking about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWGptIBApQo\">why I don't do Linux \"evangelism\"</a>.
This is part of the ever growing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-p5XmQHB_JRlxgcaj-WxkAylXFuE0gyk\">\"Boomer Rants in Woods\"</a> series.
</p>

<p>
I detail why in the video, but it ammounts to two main points:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>People are egotistically attached to what operating system they use and treat you trying to convince them what to use as a personal insult. Trying to convince people usually ammounts to making them less open to change.</li>
	<li>Even when you can convince people that using Linux is \"good\" in an abstract sense, <em>they don't know how to</em> and usually end up trying to replicate their behavior on Windows/Mac OSX and become disappointed that they can't perfectly do so. I use my example of foobar2000 in the video.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The \"solution\" to these constraints is simple: if you want to get people to be more open to Linux, <em>show them what you can actually do on it</em>.
This solves both problems.
</p>

<p>While I certainly don't have my channel for Linux evangelism, I do feel like the channel has approached doing just that as time has gone on.
I don't talk conceptually about Linux or *nix generally unless it's after showcasing some feature or explaining the efficiency of a design.
This encourages people to actually understand Linux, how it's different from their common experience and encourages them that they might benefit from using it.

<p>I've been asked by several people to opine on Nassim Taleb's recent Twitter war against IQ as a concept.
You can read a preliminary write up of his critiques on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/incerto/iq-is-largely-a-pseudoscientific-swindle-f131c101ba39\">a Medium article he wrote</a>.
Not too refined, but if you listen you get the point.
I'll see if I can sum some of the ideas up:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>IQ is a very effective measure of outcome... on the dumb side of the distribution, but not the \"intelligent\" side. People of measured IQs of 70 are well predicted to not get far in life. The difference between 70s and 100s is massive, but the difference between 100s and 130s is not on average.</li>
	<li>Because of the above, many very strong correlations between IQ and other things are spurious because IQ isn't really so predictive/causative at all levels.</li>
	<li>Thus, IQ tests are pretty much effective in that they can detect utter morons fairly well, but so can any other arbitrarily defined test; the IQ test isn't especially effective or some grand discovery.</li>
	<li>IQ tests have been designed to award a particular type of abstract thinking that is <em>not</em> generally helpful and can lead people to be oblivious, na&iuml;ve, boring and dangerous. The Talebian <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/incerto/the-intellectual-yet-idiot-13211e2d0577\">IYI</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
On that last point, you might want to listen to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://notrelated.libsyn.com/when-youre-too-rational-to-be-rational\">the podcast I did on Gerd Gigerenzer's work</a>, which is related: we, especially psychologists, have this fetish for cargo-cult rationality, often when it leads us to be dumber/bigger chumps IRL.
Taleb is also keenly aware of the sociological aspect of academia, the replication crisis, the wishful thinking and confirmation bias ubiquitous in the soft (i.e. non-) sciences.
Many people will correctly call IQ or <em>g</em> \"the most successful\" finding of psychological sciences in the 20th century.
I say \"correctly\" because everything else psychological \"sciences\" have found is either totally non-reproduceable or the result of smoke-and-mirrors, so, sure IQ is number 1 in a field of continual failure.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, on the topic, a lot of Boomers will deny any potential reality of IQ/g or any other kinds of cognitive tests out of a deep-seated faith in total human cognitive uniformity (otherwise that would make them literally Hitler).
This isn't really Taleb's motivation: his, if I my psychoanalyze for a moment, amounts to a disappointment with the pseudo-rationalist \"funcionary\" thought-patterns that an IQ test favors being celebrated as a cognitive ideal, when in reality these mental habits aren't really so correlated with success outside of bureaucracy.
Taleb certainly loves to dab on n*rds and I support his efforts.
That and a conviction to sound understanding of statistics drive him.
</p>

<p>
Is \"IQ\" <em>utterly meaningless</em>?
No I don't think so, nor do I think Taleb thinks so, but it's only a clumsy and introductory mosaic used to approach human cognitive differences and we shouldn't necessarily treat it as a mentalistic holon without careful caveats.
As he puts it in the above Medium article:
</p>

<blockquote>
\"If you renamed IQ, from \"Intelligent Quotient\" to FQ \"Functionary Quotient\" or SQ \"Salaryperson Quotient\", then some of the stuff will be true. It measures best the ability to be a good slave. \"IQ\" is good for @davidgraeber's \"BS jobs\".\"
</blockquote>

<p>
\"Autism Quotient\" might be another candidate.
IQ shows <em>something</em>, but I think a lot of Taleb's critique comes down to assumption that \"high IQ\" tendencies are not necessarily either good or indicative of intelligence in a meaningful sense.
I think there is a strong correlation between IQ what we intuitively think of as \"intelligence\", but you must take that with Taleb's qualifiers mentioned above and the fact that for some cultural reasons (and pity), we think of autistic shut-ins and losers in high-school as being \"intelligent\" (thus the concept of IQ has affected what we think of as being smart).
In the past, autistic shut-ins were understood to be utter morons and the ideal intelligent person might be an outgoing, socially-aware, but \"irrationally\" cautious, high-agency person with little attention to detail.
If \"IQ\" measured <em>that</em> kind of person, which we could easily do, we would likely find some of the same correlations since like our \"IQ\" it rules out the extremely dull, but such a test might be likely to have better life-performance correlations as well.
</p>


<p>
To sum up, I mostly concur with what Taleb says, but I also don't particularly mind using the term \"IQ\" in the way it's conventionally understood so long as it's not understood as some eternal metric of goodness.
I did speak somewhat about the selection of cognitive ability, measured by IQ in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://notrelated.libsyn.com/the-agricultural-revolution-has-been-a-disaster-for-the-human-race\">one of my other podcasts</a>, but my editorial stance was that that selection was not necessarily \"good\".
Like Taleb says in the quote above, a person with a high IQ tends to be a good functionary, a good cog in the system. Perhaps to slavishly obey social orders one does necessitate some level of real intelligence, but that servile and autistic mentality not what true intelligence causes <em>per se</em>, nor should we celebrate than kind of mindset.
</p>

<p>
If anything Taleb says sounds like gibberish, I recommend you either to read his books (<em>Skin in the Game</em>, <em>Antifragile</em>, etc. etc.) or wait for his next inevitable book which I'm sure will include the IQ discussion.
Taleb has a tendency to put things in superficially coarse phrasing online, but his books are lucid beyond comprehension.

<p>I occasionally get asked why I use my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKumet6b-WY\">\"ugly\" status bar</a> which is a simple i3blocks with gaudy emojis rather than the more elegant polybar which I used in earlier videos, like say, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BOW61luzF4\">this one</a>, or bumblebee-status, which I used even earlier <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U3vRbF7v5A\">here</a>.</p>

<p>First, right off the bat, I know a lot of people think of me as a desktop \"ricer\", i.e. someone who makes substantial changes to their computers for aesthetic purposes, but this really isn't the case. The only sense in which I care about my computer's appearance is its ability to present important things very obviously and the speed with which I can do whatever thing I'm doing on a computer. \"Ricing\" a term that comes from the automobile-modification world meaning \"Race-Inspired Cosmetic Enhancement\". A true ricer is all about making his computer elegant. I'm not. I care about efficiency and do have some minor aesthetic things (like transparency), but these are only to keep me from getting bored out of my mind. I even used solarized colors for a while which shows obviously I don't care <em>that much</em> about how a computer looks.</p>

<p>If you want a very good example of real ricing, I recommend you check out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vQCiSOcYrI\">this recent video by iBSD</a>, where he shows a AwesomeWM configuration theming it to Game of Thrones. That might sound absurd and pure flex, but check it out; it's very impressive.</p>

<p>But anyway, there are a couple specific reasons I don't use \"the pretty\" polybar:</p>

<ul>
	<li>On Arch Linux, there is no polybar binary and you must compile it from the AUR. No big deal for a user, but since I maintain <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://larbs.xyz\">LARBS</a> and have hundreds of people weekly (sometimes daily) installing my system, this constant compiling of a system basic component on many different computers leads to <em>a lot</em> of problems, many of which I can't troubleshoot.</li>
	<li>Related to the above, polybar has a bad tendency to break on the updating/renaming of a library. It's the only package I know of that does this regularly.</li>
	<li>Polybar is <em>different</em> from and independent from the typical i3bar and lacks some of its abilities. Honestly one of the things that was the straw that broke the camel's back for me was the fact that you can't easily run a command to toggle/hide polybar. Additionally, you have to get use to restarting polybar on screen refresh and having an extra script for generating in the way you want on multiple monitors. Some of that is <em>good</em> in that it means customizeability on different monitors, but since I'm not a big fan of multi-monitor setups, it doesn't mean much to me.</li>
	<li>I do sort of enjoy the \"ugliness\" of </li>
</ul>

<p>My reasons for bumblebee-status anymore are somewhat similar (with the additional fact that it's written in Python and tended to eat up system resources).</p>

<p>Anyway. I only write all this because I am sort of thinking of configuring a \"prettier\" statusbar, but since people ask about my previous choices I want to make it clear what I care about in system configuration.
If you have any suggestions of a status bar that...
</p>

<ul>
	<li>...exists in the main Arch repos,</li>
	<li>is configurable,</li>
	<li>light on system resources,</li>
	<li>has few (or no) dependencies,</li>
	<li>can be easily togged,</li>
	<li>and still can be made very pretty...</li>
</ul>

</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can designate arbitrary commands to run on images via a custom script. I set up commands to make images the wallpaper, move or copy them to directories and run imagemagick commands on them.</li>
	<li>.gif animations are supported, which feh can't do.</li>
	<li>It comes with a free thumbnail view as well, which can be very handy for sorting through images. I'm moving away from using ranger with its single image previews and this is a big plus.</li>

feh can, hence I still have it installed and use it for that, but if anyone knows how to make sxiv do the same, please tell me so I can save a dependency in LARBS. ;-)

<p>Hi everyone! I want to thank all who showed up for the New Years livestream, especially those who donated.</p>

<p>If I occasionally sound burnt out on making videos, I have to say that that's mostly illusion or temporary and I'm very glad with the success the channel has had in the past year.
I hope to go a lot further, while not fundamentally altering the quality or realness of the channel.
No irrelevant sponsors or special production team.
</p>

<p>I forgot to say until deep into the stream, but the thing I have my eye on getting for the channel next is an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crowdsupply.com/eoma68/micro-desktop\">EOMA68 computer card</a> and casing.
This is an upcoming and experimental kind of privacy/freedom-respecting computer that appeals to my non-consumerism and sense of efficiency: it's modular, utterly free/libre from the bottom up and designed with a mostly 3D printable case.
I talked about the EOMA68 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvHUDHqSeuM\">in a video</a>, but haven't yet gotten my hands on one, despite thinking that it represents very positive movements in computer construction.
Obviously I plan on testing and reviewing it for all of you; I'm optimistic about it.
</p>

<p>
The \"actual computer\" part is a severable card that is supposed to be hosted in different ports: a laptop shell or a desktop shell, etc.
This reduces redundancy and easily separates the outward shell from the computer itself, both of which can be easily replaced if damaged or obsolete.
The computer card itself actually has pretty unimpressive specs, but this early in the game, that's part of the fun.
It is also lacking some typical ports (last time I did research on it, I don't believe there was an ethernet port, so you'd either need an ethernet adapter or wifi dongle).
These deficiencies are related to the adherence to strict open hardware standards from what I can glean.
</p>

<p>
In the livestream, I raised enough money for the computer card itself (I'll be getting one with Parabola GNU/Linux), but also for the desktop casing and then some.
I'll be buying these soon (together they are $120 and then taxes, etc.).
I'd also like to buy the laptop casing which is either $450-500 depending on whether I can 3D print the parts myself, but we didn't quite raise that much.
If you'd like to see me review the laptop casing as well, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/donate\">please donate</a> and I'll order it too!
Honestly, I'd sort of like to start a crowd funding account just so people can see where there money is going to, I might do that.
Either way, I'll be getting the desktop casing and the computer card before they ship out on February 1st.
</p>

<p>Of course if you or someone you know is involved with the EOMA68, you could always send me a freebie and that money can go to the project next on the list. 😉</p>

I sort of got this ball rolling on YouTube at the start of my channel when I put out my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zpgQpdy_fI\">How to Choose a Linux distro: Stop Thinking!</a> video and it was the first result for any \"Linux\" search for a while.
</p>

<p>
I certainly don't take any of it back, but as time has gone on, I'm starting to think that the distribution I've been using for all this time might be \"the best\" in some sense.
It doesn't do anything <em>particularly good</em>, but avoids all the hassles that most distributions do not.
It also puts users in a place where they can more competently deal with system problems in an intelligent way.
</p>

<p>
What distro am I talking about? Well, you probably already know, but <em>let's find out!</em> 👉

<p>Most people do. Luckily, for all the complaining, there is a simple replacement for it that cuts out the middle man altogether and transfers money directly and immediately between bank accounts.</p>

<p>You probably haven't heard of it, but there is a new money transfer system that most banks in the United States maintain called <b>Zelle</b>.
It's really just a protocol for transferring money directly from account to account with just an email, so it works pretty much with the ease of PayPal.
It is actually a service offered for free (no fees at all) by most American banks.
</p>

<p><b>If you have any bank account in the United States, you probably already have Zelle and don't know it.</b></p>

<p>So for all those who want to donate to the channel but don't want to be bothered to use Paypal/Patreon, here's how to use it:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Log on to your online banking for whatever bank you have.</li>
	<li>Search for a \"transfer money\" or \"Zelle\" section.</li>
	<li>(You may have to confirm your email, but \"setup\" is automatic.)</li>
	<li>When asked for a recipient, just put in my email address: <big>luke@lukesmith.xyz</big></li>
</ul>

<p>Benefits of Zelle:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It's managed by banks as a free tool for their customers, so it doesn't skim some money off the top of your donation.</li>
	<li>You don't need to sign up and create an account on some new website.</li>
	<li>You can send a single lump-sum donation if you hate PayPal, or set up recurring donations if you hate Patreon.</li>
	<li>Zelle, being owned by banks regulated up the wazoo is less likely to ZUCC you. I've never heard of anyone being ZUCCed by them in fact.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, you can donate <em>directly</em> to me, no charge using Zelle and my email:</p>

<p>I want to thank again Henok S. for getting me and the channel the simple yet elegant ThinkVision T2224D monitor!
I showcase it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfwerXTCb1c\">here in a new video</a>!
This is less of a gift to me than a gift to everyone who watches my channel because it means that my screencasts will be recorded in full wide 1080p HD, and not the awkward 1680x1050 resolution of the fatt TV monitor I used to use and then mutilated by the resolution requirements of YouTube into 1152x720!
</p>

<p>
You can see from the video (probably if you're watching in 1080p or even less) that the screen and webcam should be a good bit crisper since it's no longer going through that awkward conversion.
On my side, the color of the monitor is also fantastic.
Obviously you can't really see it, but it definitely makes a difference for me.
</p>

<p>
I deliberately also got an IPS panel and it looks great (I had to read up on screen technology a little when shopping around).
I have an IPS on my X220 and had always noticed the much more vivid colors compared to other screens. It made me <em>prefer</em> to use the smaller laptop screen on occasions.
The IPS panel is seriously great looking. It doesn't come over in photos how good it looks, so I can't directly show you, but it is very comfortable.
I had to read up on different options, but it seems that IPS is pretty much the best unless you want more Hertz for video-gayming. I definitely love it.
</p>

<p>
The monitor I got was on the cheap side, a little over $100.
There are more expensive equivalents, including other made by Lenovo, that often come with either speakers, USB ports, more ports for displays and other options, sometimes even webcams.
I just wanted a monitor that was a monitor (and didn't want to make my benefactor feel obliged to buy an extortionate item ;-)).
If I want to \"expand\" later, I can get a dual display with a fancier thing, but what I have is already great, and much better than before!
</p>

<p>So again, you can look foward to seeing my screencasts in 1080p and can thank Henok for that!</p>

<p>
You may've heard of <em>physiognomy</em>, which is the study of how people's
physical appearances or faces relate to their psychology or personality.
Physiognomy is interesting because it was one of those many fields brushed
aside as \"pseudo-scientific\" ironically enough my the early 20th century bugman
scientists who lacked the tools to study it (and were also afraid of something
that could be perceived as wacist).  Nowadays, however, with better
experimental techniques and sometimes even the aid of artificial intelligence,
there have arisen a lot of different experimental studies finding that
physiognomy is very real as a correlation between body/facial structure and
personality, but also that people are very good at judging other peoples'
personalities from that structure.
</p>

<p>
This often trickles into the news media when we hear about faces being \"gay\" or
\"racist\". We hear about how political persuasion correlates with body strength
or religious zeal being readable from one's face.  There are more subtle
things, like a person's index to ring finger ratio that are registers of
prenatal testosterone, thus correlating with all manners of things. And then
there's left-handedness.
</p>

<p>
This shouldn't be a surprise for anyone.
The nerd and the chad have separate personalities, but their different bodies and dispositions reflect them.
One might cause the other, or be related for other reasons, but the correlations are there and everyone knows and recognizes them.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, for the podcast <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://notrelated.xyz\">NotRelated.xyz</a>, I'm planning on doing an episode on physiognomy.
Yes, I know I haven't put out an episode in around month, but I've been unable to record due to factors out of my control ;-).
I have this and two (sort of three) other episodes under construction and I think once I move to my new place January, I'll have <em>much</em> more recording time.
</p>

<p>
<b>I'm saying all this because I'm curious if people reading have any physiognomy data or even anecdotes.</b> I've compiled a lot of studies on this kind of stuff over time, but feel free to send me what you have.
There's a big and speculative field out there, so I'd like to cover what people have found interesting even if I haven't found it myself.

<p>I know a couple of you guys out there use <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb\">my blog script, lb,</a> for your personal blogs.
Advertised as a \"Blog &amp; RSS system in less than 100 lines of shell script\". It's minimal, easy to customize and I've been using it for months now.
If you didn't see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIfAdzGmhik\">the original video</a>, there's the link.
</p>

<p>The script allows you to write blog posts that are then automatically syndicated in several locations of your choosing:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A rolling blog page: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/blog.html\">lukesmith.xyz/blog.html</a></li>
	<li>A blog index page (can be placed in your index if desired): <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/blogindex.html\">lukesmith.xyz/blogindex.html</a></li>
	<li>All posts appear in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/blog\">blog/</a> directory, which can be accessible via Apache settings.</li>
	<li>RSS entries, containing the full blog post are added to your RSS feed of choice (e.g. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml\">lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
But yesterday I rewrote the script, actually making it shorter while adding some nice features.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The ability to revise already published articles</li>
	<li>Smarter URL creation. The old script made somewhat dumb urls.</li>
	<li>Use of the <code>.htaccess</code> file as a database to store filename-title correspondences and now publishing dates</li>
	<li>In the editing mode, only the text content, not the header or footer will appear in your editor. This is a side-effect of the fact above, since before, I had used the magic of script-kiddery to read from the buffer on publishing to determine the post's title. Now it's stored in <code>.htaccess</code> so that's not necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The script is backwards compatible with the old script, although the commands have slightly changed (just run the command and it will tell you how) and if you've been working on unpublished drafts in lb 1.0, you must still publish them with lb 1.0.
This backwards compatibility means that you can also revise old published blog entries without much of a problem.
The only hiccup is the fact that if you revise a blog entry published with lb 1.0, when republished it will appear only with the new date.
This should not be true of articles published by this lb 2.0.
</p>

<p>To \"install\" the blog script, simply download it to the wanted blog directory and change the variables in it to seek the correct files (the RSS feed, blog file, blog index).
You must add a comment line that looks exactly like this:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- LB --&gt;</code></pre>

<p>to each file. That line is the point in the document after which new articles/RSS entries/list entries will be added.

<p>
The common way of looking at Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is that it's a metric of economic success: more GDP is more wealth.
Wealth is good. \"Poverty\" (meaning low <em>per capita</em> GDP) is bad.
Nowadays, pretty much everyone talks about \"economics\" like this as if this truism was scribbled on the back walls of the cosmos.
</p>

<p>
This is just looking at one side of the ledger in a kind of global double-entry accounting book.
A logically equivalent way of looking at it is that <b>GDP is the metric of economic exchange required for survival in society as it exists</b>.
You can say that some area \"produced\" $1B USD of output (sounds good), but you can just as easily say that $1B USD was required for that area to sustain itself (sounds bad).
These two are simply logically equivalent.
</p>

<p>
Let's dive into the Gestalt: when you hear that a family of eight lives on less than a dollar per day (PPP adjusted), you might wonder how they manage!
To <em>actually</em> do such a thing would require buying large bags of rice for the whole family, eat only that and live in free cardboard boxes.
The reality is that that often uttered phrase means that they use less than $1 a day in the general economy, while the rest of their livelihood is \"off-the-grid\" or self-sufficient.
They may grow food in a family farm, hunt for food, and most of their daily needs from cooking oils, to plates, to pottery, to soap are often made at home as well.
There is still \"an economy\" but often one that is barter based or <em>socialist</em> in the real pre-socialist sense of the word: mediated by direct face-to-face social tit-for-tat between neighbors and friends, none of this mediated by currency being exchanged, thus it is not part of the GDP.
</p>

<p>
If you read about some Bangladeshi village where the only product is \"textiles\", that doesn't mean that everyone there makes textiles all day and, without a textile company, everyone would've starved to death.
It means that the only on-paper, measurable global industry practiced there is textile manufacturing.
Other villagers might farm, hunt, even do some kind of gathering in some places.
They will produce the arts and crafts and live the way people live when you leave them alone.
If your view of the world is mediated by GDP, you're only seeing the extremely small sliver that pops into existence when people exchange something involving legal tender.
</p>

<p>
This is extremely difficult for us modern bugpeople to understand because to be a bugman in a large city is to produce absolutely nothing on one's own and buy literally everything you need from the store.
To us non-productive people, GDP means income which means survival.
But the further out of Bugmanville you go, the clearer the vacuousness of GDP becomes.
</p>

<p>
A minor example.
We had a large Thanksgiving feast near my uncle's house in very rural Florida.
As it got cold in the night, we had a fire in a repurposed old sugar cane cooking vat artfully standing on used symmetrical cinderblock pieces.
A bugman hipster might pay two hundred dollars or more for a similar looking \"authentic\" piece of equipment. Those $200 would be counted in the GDP.
A bugman hipster might have also bought or rented chairs for the event, \"contributing\" more to the GDP, but my uncle, as part of the local wholesome church community, simply borrowed some from the church.
Thus our event produced basically no GDP output in goods or services, despite being functionally equivalent to some similar but expensive and ergo \"productive\" \"Friendsgiving\" practiced by urbanites.
In reality <em>we</em> are richer than the bugmen hipsters who blew hundreds of dollars on a faux-folksy party.
In this case, we owned the firepit and had easy access and permission to the chairs, thus we are more economically flexible than they are.
That GDP that they produced/expended is evidence of deeper reliance on the economic system.
That GDP output is a marker of <em>fragility</em>, reliance on the conditions of the outside economy in the same way that a village of Bangladeshis who abandon their traditional way of lives to work on textiles are more fragile, despite being able to save up for iPhones.
</p>

<p>
Much of the increase in GDP across the world is simply the movement from local partially-social partially-under-the-table economies to economies mediated by taxable currency.
An economically self-sufficient village with close social relationships and a barter economy has 0 GDP.
A township of entrepreneurs and artisans you partially barter and partially use currency which they don't report has 0 GDP.
All of these people are \"in poverty\" and \"earn less than a dollar a day\".
And if you want to be truly self-sufficient, that means having a personal GDP of zero.
</p>

<p>
More than that, pretty much everywhere, GDP is a strong indicator of social upheaval.
If you think that GDP is some eternal goodness, remember that <em>everything \"good\" about industrialization shows up in the GDP</em>, while at the same time, <em>everything bad about it will not show up</em>.
Or, sometimes bad things are registered as positive economic growth: urbanization has caused mass-disease, and if that means a market for new medical services and pharmaceuticals, great!
The GDP just went up!
The Ganges is polluted due to the textile plant? That just means more opportunities for local entrepreneurs to sell bottled water!
The GDP just went up!
Are people being pushed out of fishing or other subsistence occupations because of it? Even better! Now they have no choice but to contribute to the GDP!
With every passing year, in fact, more and more of the GDP is produced by dealing with the problems that our higher level of GDP have caused.
</p>

<p>
To be clear, I am not saying that (a) GDP is utterly useless and means nothing nor (b) that having 0 GDP and thus everyone is totally self-sufficient in a barter economy is best.
I'm also not specifically arguing that industrialization is generally bad (I do think that, but my point here is irrelevant to it).
Simply put, I'm sick of big-braned moderates posting basic-ass comments on my videos about how \"X is good because it increases the GDP\", or worse, \"the GDP has been going up, so our ever increasing level of bugmanism is good\".
GDP is a bad justification for Whig history, and in areas of personal independence, it's not a good indicator.

<p>
Hi there! It appears you're new to 4chan.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you heard about it on Reddit or one of the other Content Aggregation sites you frequent.
Since you're new, let me let you in on a little secret...
You see, 4chan doesn't work like other sites.
You don't get upvotes for sharing content and no 4chan user cares about e-celebs.
</p>

<p>
You see, maybe you really like the videos I put out on YouTube.
Maybe they've really changed your life even.
That's great!
Unfortunately, it is not polite to share my videos on 4chan!
Not polite to me, nor to 4chan users!
</p>

<p>
You see, on 4chan, anonymity is paramount and e-celebrities are frowned upon.
Linking to my content unsolicited looks like an extremely cringey advertisement!
If someone specifically asks for something that I have covered, this would be an appropriate time to link to one of my videos on 4chan, albeit without fanfare or specific personal glorification of me.
However, uninvited links to my content, especially saying \"Wow look what Luke Smith did\" when no one asks is the highest form of faux pas.
</p>

<p>
Since 4chan is an anonymous message board, you also make me look bad because people might think I, in sheer desperation for views, am the one linking by videos for consumption on the board.
I am very ashamed when I see my personality brought up my a cringey fan on 4chan.
As I've become more popular, this evokes stronger and stronger feelings of jealousy among 4chan users.
Thus sharing my content is not appropriate behavior there, although on other sites it might be fine!
</p>

<p>
Remember that everyone who matters on /g/ already watches my channel.
Those who don't know about it could easily find my tutorials and other content on any topic by searching for them if needed.
On 4chan, respecting other users' <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politeness_theory#Positive_and_negative_face\">Negative Face</a> is a high priority unless you are simply shitposting, so please do not be overbearing, especially with respect to people with public internet presences like myself.

</p>

To put it succinctly, some pretentious Zoomer males (of which there are many on YouTube) have a way of talking that I can only describe as sounding like they're talking with their mouths semi-full...
It's some unique way of posturing their mouth, but I can't say what exactly this is articulatorily.

I want to compile more examples of this.
I actually don't want to link specific examples of this because I'm curious first if other people have noticed this in certain personalities.

The topic is the reality of what is actually \"logical\" in the brain and in human action.
In your intro psychology classes, you'll likely be inundated with stories of the cognitive glitches that humans suffer from, most of which stemming from the prying research of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in the so-called <em>Heuristics and Biases</em> program.

But in this episode we briefly review this perspective, but also the rejoinder to it in the school of thought typically termed <em>Ecological Rationality</em>, specifically as described in Gerd Gigerenzer's <em>Rationality for Mortals: How People Cope with Uncertainty</em>.
From this perspective, many very human tendencies which will appear \"irrational\" in terms of formal logic are very reasonable in real life, and humans are equiped with an Adaptive Toolbox of mental heuristics to deal with complex problems.

<p>I just put up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npht_ISGL0g\">a video on this</a>, but I'll put it in text for anyone who prefers it.</p>

<p>After a lot of requests, I'm going to start doing livestreams again.
Problem is, until next January, I won't have consistent internet at my home to make that possible.
So we can manage a little workaround:
</p>

<p>
I'm now, right now, taking \"Super Chats\" or donations from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://paypal.me/lukemsmith\">PayPal</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"crypto.html\">different crypto currencies</a>.
I'll record full responses to questions in the same way I would do a livestream.
I'll probably also come with other content prepared.
</p>

<p>
Then, that full video, the length and style of a livestream will be uploaded to YouTube using the new \"Premiere\" feature, which allows a set release time and a chatroom just like in livestreams.
Everyone can watch it together then, talking in the chat.
Obviously I'll be in the chatroom as it plays for everyone simultaneously.
</p>

<p>I'm planning to release this video <b>Sunday afternoon</b>.</p>

<p>That means if you want to donate to ask a question or pose a comment or point of discussion, donate (using the links about) ASAP.
I'm not entirely sure when I'm going to be recording the video, but I suspect sometime Saturday.
If you miss that window though, I'll read your donation and talk about what you want next time, so no problem.

<p>I've been cleaning out a whole lot of old crud on my computer, and some of this is making its way into my dotfiles.
To make sure you know what I'm moving around, I'll put a notice here. Especially if you fetch or pull the new changes, be away of what's below so you don't get confused.</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>~/.scripts/shortcuts.sh</code> has now lost the <code>.sh</code> to keep with the style of the other scripts. It also no longer downloads template files if not present (this was a holdover of when it was part of its own repo).</li>
	<li>Similarly, the <code>~/.scripts/folders</code> and <code>~/.scripts/configs</code> files that the script used have moved to the home directory, to <code>~/.key_directories</code> and <code>~/.key_files</code>. The name change of the later reflects that I now use this file and the shortcut script to just to text documents I'm working on, not just config files. In the short future, I'll have other scripts reading these files as well. I haven't really added any lines to the public copies though, as I still expect them to be very user-dependent.</li>
	<li>The <code>dmenuunicode</code> script I showcased in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCEXY46t3OA\">a recent video</a> has undergone a small addition that will also copy the unicode character's code value to primary selection while the character itself is copied to the clipboard. There are times when this can be very useful when it's necessary to get code. The input file for this script has also been moved to <code>~/.emojis</code> and now was many more emojis, including flags 🇺🇸.</li>
	<li><b>Importantly, I am also cleaning out now unused configs files that I do not maintain.</b> Since this is a git repo, obiovusly nothing is lost to time, but the dotfiles for polybar, qutebrowser, rofi and other programs I don't use anymore won't be there by default on LARBS unless I hear an outcrying to the contrary. I know I got many people using polybar and qutebrowser, but qb's settings are constantly changing, so I can't be expected to keep up and polybar has always been riddled with compilation problems. (Since users need to compile it anyway, it's been a thorn in my side for LARBS as well in the past.)</li>

New video up on how to automatically format references in groff/troff, using <code>refer</code>. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/yTQbi_E_Gys\">Check it out here!</a>
You now should be able to get your term papers done in groff pretty easily! 😉
</p>

<p>As we talked about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfOwRYmb5bQ\">in the last video</a>, <code>refer</code> is considerably faster than formatting your references with biber in LaTeX.
<code>refer</code> is pretty well customizeable on the command line and in-text, but there's a lot more to the program than is just in the man; feel free to share what things you run across.
</p>

<p>
I don't think I said so in the video, but <code>refer</code> is mostly intended to work with the <code>ms</code> and <code>me</code> macro set.
I haven't tried it on others, but it may have some level of functionality, despite being intended for papers and such.

One of you emailed me soon after noting that you can simply give groff the <code>-k</code> option which will automatically run the file through <code>preconv</code>, a program that automatically converts unicode characters to code readable by groff/troff with no extra work and no ugly formatting!
Now THIS is ebin.
Thanks again, Efe, for this emendation.
You still can do it in the way I mentioned, but would you really want to when its this easy?

Remember also, that while I'm doing videos on groff, I'm probably one of only several dozen who have tried to navigate the scant groff/troff documentation in the past decade.

As you may know, a recurring joke on the channel is this constant torrent of new users constantly asking \"how did you get your computer to look like that\".

<p>I've already gotten a lot of questions about this, and while I might do a video on it later, I might as well put the answer here for those who are interested.</p>

<p>By default groff and troff have no such compatibility with accented characters, which, if you had the misfortune of being born to a language besides the glorious American tongue, makes writing quite documents in groff difficult.</p>

<p>Obviously there are many ways of bridging this gap, some you could easily invent on your own, but there are indeed built in escape sequences for most characters needed for other languages in the Latin alphabet.</p>

<p>Check out the documentation <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/manual/html_node/ms-Strings-and-Special-Characters.html#ms-Strings-and-Special-Characters\">here in the GNU manuals</a> on escape sequences not only for adding accents to characters, but also for needed symbols in other languages like the German ß, the Spanish ¿ or Icelandic/Old English þ and ð.</p>

<p>If you're like me and you don't want to bother typing such silly escape sequences out, you could always automate their appearance in vim whenever you type the corresponding character. Below I have the lines for the acute characters.</p>

<code>
autocmd Filetype groff inoremap á \\*[']a</br>
autocmd Filetype groff inoremap Á \\*[']A</br>
autocmd Filetype groff inoremap é \\*[']e</br>
autocmd Filetype groff inoremap É \\*[']E</br>
autocmd Filetype groff inoremap í \\*[']i</br>
autocmd Filetype groff inoremap Í \\*[']I</br>
autocmd Filetype groff inoremap ó \\*[']o</br>
autocmd Filetype groff inoremap Ó \\*[']O</br>
autocmd Filetype groff inoremap ú \\*[']u</br>
autocmd Filetype groff inoremap Ú \\*[']U</br>
</code>

<p>You can add what you want.</p>

<p>
Be also sure that vim is properly detecting your filetype, adding <code>autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.ms,*.me,*.mom set filetype=groff</code> beforehand will do the trick for .ms, .me and .mom files.

I just put up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfOwRYmb5bQ\">a brief video</a> comparing the efficiency of formatting a document with references in LaTeX via biber vs. using groff/troff via <code>refer</code>.
</p>

<p>
Check it out yourself, but needless to say, groff gets the job done just as well in a small sliver of the time LaTeX takes.
<code>refer</code> as a preprocessor, simply reads a groff file, checking for inserts of <code>refer</code> syntax and edits the stream adding the bibliography details from a database file that groff can read.
As expected in stream manipulation, it all happens basically instantaneously, much faster than TeX's method of puking out build files to be read by subsequent commands.

troff (groff is the GNU version) is a unix utility for document formatting and type-setting which is built into your system and substantially faster, more minimal, and more manipulatible on the command line than TeX or compiling via R markdown or pandoc.

I've been playing around with it for a while now and am continually impressed with how easy it is.
Its adherence to UNIX principles makes extending it extremely easy, and in future videos I'll talk about the many ways you can extend it (again, already bulit into your system), including adding images, tables, and refernces in a way similar to Bibtex.

Right now, it's not yet open to the public, but it will be soon.
I'll update you when that happens via RSS, and might even put up a video.

	<li><b>Uncle Luke's Cabin</b> (sounds somewhat ghey, but I think most people get the proper reference)</li>
	<li><b>Uncle Luke's GNU/Cabin</b> (combo of those two, I'm leaning to this right now)</li>

I might link forum.notrelated.xyz to it though.

Some people suggested in the past I should give the forum a generic /g/ related name to make it accessible to people outside of my channel.
Frankly here's no point in pretending it isn't anything my <em>my</em> forum, especially since the topics unified under that might have little relationship with each other except in the sublimated way that the topics on my channel are related at a sublimated level.
I'm not against rebranding it without my name in the future, but at the beginning, the unifying force between all my users is me and it wouldn't make sense to base the branding on something that only a subset of the users have in common.

<p>
This coming weekend, I'll be taking a partially-family-related-partially-personal trip up to Indiana with some crucial stops on the way.
The only complication is that I don't own a car, so my four-state trip will be mediated by bus, meaning I'll be paying much less than I would be for gas or a plane and I'll have plenty of time for uninterrupted reading and work. I've also bought a ThinkPad slice battery that I'll be picking up right before, so I can try that out as well.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, why I'm going to Indiana isn't important for you, but as many of you know, I've been in the market for land recently, and have been planning on buying a remote plot for building a large cabin or small house for a long-term home or short-term place for vacation and storage.
On my way back from my trip, I'll be stopping in Tennessee to look at some parcels.
I don't want to spend more than $20,000 for land, and I'd like to get at least 5 acres for that (ideally less and more of course).
I'm already doing the math for how much it will cost to build a house to my specifications, but a lot is going to be a function of what kind of land I can get
</p>

<p>
I've picked Tennessee because it's still relatively close to my family, but is politically and regulatorily much better than Georgia.
There's low property tax, no state income tax, relatively free homeschooling and apparently less zoning/building restrictions in most places.
Georgia on the other hand is literally a 56% state nowadays (well according to Wikipedia, 55.9% actually), which means sooner or later it will be a blue state.
Of course, even if blue in a presidential election, it would probably only be a generation later before this filters down into local elections, which realistically means over-regulation and extreme managerial state is still fairly distant. Still, since I have the choice of where to put roots down, it's an easy one. I have thought of places further north: Kentucky or West Virginia, but the proximity to Georgia is still a minor plus for me. I don't know how the situation is going to be in Tennessee by the time my children have to think about this, but I'll be working for it to be good.
</p>

<p>
I'll also enjoy the milder climate in Tennessee. I honestly just want to be where I don't need an air-conditioner for most of the year.</p>

<p>Anyway, if everything works out, there might be a house-building, property-maintenance and bushcraft portion of my channel before too long. I can't say when, but if I find something good, I might be moving into the area and renting a place while I work on my new home. Another hopeful result of this would be reducing my economic needs to nearly nothing by self-sufficiency, enough that I could even life exclusively off my online income... or less.</p>

You may've noticed I haven't done a livestream in a while, but I'm thinking to start again.
I'm not entirely sure how my internet up connection is here, but I might be doing a stream next Tuesday or Wednesday around midday around Amerimutt time.

<p>
There's an often repeated idea out there that humans went through a population bottleneck about 70,000 years ago, shrinking to a group of only several thousands. This bottleneck is typically attributed to the Toba Eruption.
This is something you've probably heard <em>ad nauseam</em> in every popular science depiction of human prehistory, I sure have.
I won't give specifics because I don't want to bias you, but in doing research for a future podcast episode, I began to doubt this idea and tried to pry into its actual origins to see what the actual evidence of it was.
</p>

<p>
I was surprised to learn that the idea didn't actually come from some scholarly consensus, but is a still very controversial idea originally posited by a journalist Ann Gibbons of <i>Science</i>.
Now anyone who knows me knows that I am the absolutely last to write off an idea or theory because it's posited by a lay(wo)man out of the academic system, but in the case of a <em>journalist</em> (that class of people whose ratios of what-they-know to what-they-think-they-know are extremely low), my initial doubt feels a little vindicated.
</p>

<p>
I've been groping through some scientific literature on the subject, there are indeed some mainstream supporters, but from what I can tell, the evidence for it is very scant, at least far too scant to warrant its commonplace presentation in popular science.
As well, it seems that a lot of people in other fields base some of their assumptions on this idea, not knowing its non-universality, thus giving their theories a shaky foundation.
</p>

<p>I bring this up because I'm curious if anyone reading has had specific, semi-direct knowledge or experience with the feeling in the field.
As I said, I'm gradually reading the literature on it already, but I'm curious to know an insider's view (or at least the view of someone well-informed on it).
Is this idea well-accepted?
Is the circumstantial evidence for it considered up to snuff?
Are there good reasons to think it's <em>not</em> true?
Email me what you think.

The general argument of the book is that America, as it exists ethno-culturally has never been one unit, but four loosely competitive and highly distinct cultures, directly rooted in particular British origins.
On the surface this book is a dense and well-researched ethnography, but deeper than that, it has a lot of hot take-aways for American socio-political life.

<p>
The talk of the meme-o-sphere recently has been on NPCs (non-player characters), not in video games, but in real life.
Originally, \"NPC\" arose as a term of abuse approximating \"normie\" or \"brainlet\", but there have been some who are realizing that it might have more truth to it than anticipated.
</p>

<p>
For a while now, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3yrw2i/i_never_thought_with_language_until_now_this_is/\">post from le Reddit</a> has been circulating from a somewhat disturbed user divulged that he only recently began thinking in language, saying that his life before \"mindless\" and \"soul-less\" and described himself as \"barely even conscious\".
One might also be reminded of the quip of James Huneker on Chopin's &Eacute;tude Op. 25, Num. 11 (better known nowadays by being quoted by Douglass Hofstadter in G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach) that \"small-souled men, no matter how agile their fingers, should avoid it\".
Of course, listeners of the biggest-braned podcast <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://notrelated.xyz\">Not Related!</a> will remember in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://notrelated.xyz/the-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind\">the episode on the Bicameral Mind</a>, we talked on Julian Jaynes's theory of consciousness, in which consciousness is not something inherent to our biological inventory, but a kind of mental habit we develop, partially based on the metaphors of language and our need in society.
Different societies and cultures are liable to create different levels of consciousness in people.
</p>

<p>
There seems to be circumstantial evidence everywhere that the internal worlds of others just are not quite the same as ours.
There's a huge scientific and epistemological problem though: how can we empirically and objectively verify the nature consciousness, an aspect of mental life which is by its nature accessible only subjectively?
</p>

<p>
I dont think this question is answerable in the scientific mindset we currently have.
More interesting as a hint would be a deeper understanding, albeit indirect of what other people's inner worlds are like.
I'm sort of curious to hear what <b>your</b> inner life is like, and how you experience \"thinking\" if it's something unique.
</p>

<p>
I'll do my part and share with others my mental life.
I do have internal speech and am not an NPC and am indeed conscious.
My internal speech is a little bit different from how I hear others describe theirs.
Sometimes, usually when I'm thinking very slowly and deliberately, I think at only slightly faster than enunciated English in real life.
Most of the time, the \"speech\" is quite different: the best way I can describe the experience is as if you \"hummed\" the intonation of English to yourself without opening your mouth (this is not something I literally do, but how I experience it in my head). This mild humming occurs at a speed significantly faster than normal speech and though it provokes the same \"meaning\" and cognitive scaffolding as language does. It's not an annoying or abrasive humming, I should say: it's more like if someone is gently (though quickly) talking in the other room.
This hummed speech \"feels\" like English, but when I slow it down because it just gave me a great idea that I want to write down, I realize that there sometimes aren't actually English words or English syntax that directly capture what I was thinking.
</p>

<p>I should say, when I say that it \"feels\" like English, I mean that, as someone who knows a lot of different languages and has an intuitive grasp of etymology, I have distinct, almost synesthetic feelings that correspond to words of different origins. When I experience what linguists call \"tip of the tongue phenomena\" (when you forgot a word but can remember what it means and how it starts), I also can recall the approximate etymology. What I mean is that this humming speech has the same feeling as English words do.
</p>

<p>
I'd probably say that most of my mental time does <em>not</em> use this kind of internal speech.
It's not that I'm unconscious, but because I usually think about more abstract and non-linear things with interlocking, organic shapes.
This is a little closer to how some savants describe their mental life, but I suspect it's a lot more common than that, not just because I have it, but it seems to be the kind of thing that people would take for granted.
The typical description is that invisible shapes of different \"meanings\" come together and connect, or hydraulic organic machinery interacts in such a way to give you the correct answers to math problems or some advanced mental decision whose actual mechanism is opaque to you.
The thing is, while I experience this, it's something I'm only an observer of, and while I say that the shapes have \"meanings\", that's sort of my assumption, because if you could display my cognitive theater on a screen, I couldn't point out what is what with my conscious mind.
I think this is some kind of felt vision into the structure of intuition more than anything else.
</p>

<p>As a minor detail, I also have no cognitive \"me\". Or at least not unless I want one.
What I mean by that is that people will often describe themselves in their imaginations as seeing in the first person, or seeing themselves in third person (as if watching themselves on TV).
These are sometimes called the \"I\" and \"me\".
I can easily imagine myself, say, taking a walk and seeing myself walking from above, but that's not something I regularly do without prodding.
Whenever I imagine myself doing something, I see everything from my own eyes unless deliberately trying to do otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, in the future, as I read more of the literature, I might be interested in doing an episode on \"NPC\" and people's inner lifes.
If you have a mental life that is notable or distinct, feel free to email me a brief explanation. I'm curious to see what's out there.

<p>Well-known and loved water-filter merchant Alex Jones was banned from Twitter, in a move that shocked no one.
After a sustained campaign of harassment from Bluechecks, Twitter finally gave in and banned him and his site <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://infowars.com\">InfoWars.com</a>, thus depriving Twitter of Super Male Vitality and other high-energy supplements.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the straw that broke the camel's back was absolutely based.
The rationalization for the ban was the fact that yesterday Alex posted videos haranguing a CNN journalist who had worked tirelessly to get him and others banned and deplatformed.
The journalist was shook to say the least, visibly timid and obviously wishing he was a turtle so he could retract his head into his shell.
After several minutes of straight roasting (peppered with some attempted \"comebacks\" from the journo), Chuck Johnson (the guy noted for being banned from Twitter back when no one got banned) joined in as well, the video later ending with a close up of the journalist's eyes, tearing up and silently distraught.
</p>

<p>
Journo-bugmen and pseudo-intellects in universities have been subjecting Americans to a non-stop humiliation-fest and struggle session since at least the 1960s.
These people are literally paid by corporations and government organizations to demean, destroy and \"deconstruct\" the lives of the people that pay their bills.
They circulate baseless folklore and conspiracy theories about non-bugmen.
They live obliviously and smugly sit and design what they want the world of others to look like.
They talk tough and snidely on news stations and in university, but as soon as you shine the light on them, they curl up in shame.
Their pretenses only exist in their isolated world where they can't be debated, made fun of, humiliated or held accountable.
They're also just dumb.
</p>

<p>Alex's unpardonable sin is subjecting one of these chosen beings, one of these Excelsites to mockery.
Alex deserves a lot of credit for making this joker tear up.
Hopefully you're going to see a lot more of it too from more people.
If rational debate worked, Someone like Charles Murray would've won it for us decades ago. It doesn't, and now everyone hates Charles Murray. Even people on the real right.
The real solution is Chad Nationalism, Day of the Swirly, all that.
Buglibs are not serious people. Don't take them seriously. Bugmen only exist because we allow that psychological type to fester.
One might want to reread Uncle Ted's section on \"the Psychology of Modern Leftism\" as a reminder.

<p>As it comes to Infowars, of course, using platforms and social media is for brainlets anyways. Big-branes always subscribe directly to RSS feeds. Here are Infowars'; slap them in your RSS feed reader:</p>

</ul>

<p>I'm too woke for Infowars myself, but when they were originally banned from YouTube and everything else, the first thing I did was put these feeds into newsboat in raw solidarity. I'll read an article or two that sound funny and not too Boomer-con. Of course I mean no disrespect to Alex's highly esoteric (essentially Gnostic) understanding of the elite's cosmology and eschatology, which is actually unironically spot on.</p>

<p>The greatest part is that for the shitlib hivemind, it's just not enough!
Bugman brainlets are not scREEEsching about Alex being even allowed on the site in the first place.
</p>

<p>By the way, <b>stop using Twitter!</b>
Twitter, more than any other social media company is on the verge of financial ruin. Do your part and don't use the site unless via RSS feeds.
There are a couple of okay people on Twitter, but most everyone worth following has left or been banned a long time ago.

<p>Abiding by an ideological \"diet\" is pure autism. It's peak dystopian, actually. Identifying with some meme diet you've become rationally convinced of is like identifying by the music you listen to or some autistically-differentiated political label. It's something people only do in a bugman society when they've been deprived of their real identity.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, I occasionally get questions about what I eat and as I go on, my functional diet changes, but interesting patterns emerge.
Nowadays you've had meme diets from Atkins to Paleo to this new keto meme; all of them circulate around the idea that the food pyramid is a lie, and meats and fats are severely underrated.
In my experience, I'm very inclined to agree.
In fact, one of the realities of nutrition \"science\" is that a lot of the jack-booting, tone-setting and \"advocacy\" has always been done by either Jehovah's Witnesses or vegetarians, two parties who have ideological motivations to downplay the good of meat and to overplay the good of \"slave foods\" like cereals and starchy staples.
I'm not bothered by their ethical pretenses, but it's a whole nother thing to pretend that they're based in the reality of what's good for humans aside from pietisms.
</p>

<p>
First, for my younger viewers, you'll realize as you get \"old\" (as you leave puberty at least around 25), your digestive abilities and metabolism change.
The young digestive system is much more plastic and durable than someone in the late 20s and on. You've probably heard that you'll put on weight more easier if you eat pizza, true for most people, but for me, I've found that it's increasingly difficult even to properly <em>digest</em> greasy pizza, junk food, sugars and everything processed and terrible about the modern world.
As you get a little older, you really can <em>feel</em> the debilitatingly negative hormonal effects of carbo-loading. You get acid-reflux and indigestion more too. Domino's is a one-way ticket to diarrhea.
Hell, a couple weeks ago in a silly attempt to put on empty weight, I bought and ate a meek-and-mild <em>Cheerios</em> knock-off and let's just say that came out looking about the same as they went in.
</p>

<p>
Don't worry, I'm not falling apart. The solution has been easy.
Stop eating processed foods. Stop eating sugar. And Stop eating the Virgin Bottom-of-the-Food-Pyramid. Just eat meat.
</p>

<p>
I don't eat <em>only</em> meat now, but I abandoned the pretense and can acknowledge that meals are nothing more than a serving of meat with some other mostly decorative foods.
I have some vegetables and fruits here and there, and I do go out to eat and get a sandwich (with bread of course) every once in a while.
I'll say that I've realized that I can detect a little digestive difference between meat treated with antibiotics and that without. Might be confirmation bias, but I prefer untreated or organic meat and will buy it if it's not too much more expensive. Typical meals include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Chicken thighs/legs covered in garlic powder, garlic salt, thyme and rosemary. 20 minutes on oiled tray in a 425F oven.</li>
<li>Steak. Rare, duh. Cooked on the range with an entire diced onion (which becomes caramelized) and about a third of a green pepper. Occasionally topped with cheese that I grate (yup, I use cheese blocks because I'm an artiste)</li>
<li>Whole chicken, decorated internally and externally with shards of onions, garlic and sometimes potatoes. Washed with egg white. Thyme, rosemary. Covered with foil and ovened for maybe 40 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh and I use olive oil for all of these. None of that Cucknola oil BS. I'm also not big on salt.</p>

<p>And by the way, stop believing Nutrition Facts autism.
The reality of nutrition \"science\" is that the body is a machine far more complex than we understand.
The idea that our body needs precisely that 100% of all of those substances that the American government proclaimed back in the 70s is ridiculous.
For the same reason, sorry, but eating something with another random protein (like le soy) isn't a substitute for the actual nourishment of meat. My scientific proof is the diminished physical and hormonal state of vegans.
Some people will tell them they need B12 or something else, but it's far beyond that.
Regardless \"diet\" foods/sodas are the same. They only exist so they look good on the nutrition facts. They produce equivalent tastes and fill your stomach with things that you're body can't digest and turn into calories/energy. In a sane society, that would be identified as being something way worse than the thing they're supposed to be replacing.

<p>
After a recent commit, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard\">mutt-wizard</a> will now also generate an msmtprc file based on your settings. While mutt-wizard has had partial, expandable msmtp compatibility, it now all comes by default. This will increase some compatibility with some accounts and will give you more options in sending mail if you want to set personal msmtp settings. Remember to install the relevant msmtp package on your distro before sending mail!
</p>

<p>
Obviously the wizard will safely store your password and decrypt it only when necessary, just like with offlineimap.
If you want msmtp compatibility but you've already run mutt-wizard, I recommend removing your old accounts in the dialog menu and readding them (this <em>won't</em> delete you offline email so you won't have to redownload it so long as you keep the email's account name the same).
I encourage you to try it, partially because if there are errors, I'd like to find out soon! ;-)

<p>If you check my website regularly, you may've noticed that I added a \"Recent blog entries\" subheading on the main page. Each time I add a new blog entry, it'll be updated to show only the most recent five. I was asked how I do this, given that my site is static, but honestly it's the easiest thing in the world, but I'll give you a hint in case it isn't obvious.</p>

<p>
As background, I edit my website by keeping a mirror offline on my computer, then I use rsync commands (via scripts or bash aliases) to either update individually changed files, or all files. The script that updates all files also checks for other things. For example, if my CV which is in another folder has been updated, it will copy the new udpate to the website directory before uploading everything.
</p>

<p>The \"Recent blog entries\" part is also handled by this \"update all script\". Using a <code>grep</code> command, I search my blog list file for the first five blog headers, which will be the most recent entries, and I change the formatting into a list (which is actually a single line of HTML for ease) with a <code>sed</code> command. Then, with <code>sed</code> again, I search for the previously created line, delete it and replace it with the new five entries.</p>

<p>As for the specific commands, you can figure them out yourself ;-). Point is, a lot of people have this domain-dependent thinking when approaching web-based file management as if core utils are unusable and we have to rely on server-side scripts even to do basic things. This is a bad mindset that causes incalculable harm on the web. Obviously core utils aren't going to get you true dynamically generated sites, but you can get most use cases out of plain HTML and should try to do so whenever possible.</p>

<p>I've been contemplating for a while to do a podcast series, partially at the desires of viewers and I think it's now going to happen. The general format is going to be on weekly topics, at the beginning focusing on particular books of political, scientific or other note. I originally was searching around for a co-host, but honestly couldn't find anyone I particularly liked for the job. I'm open to one in the future, but I think I'm setting myself on a detailed monologue format for now.</p>

<p>I've gotten specific requests for books and topics, but it's going to follow only my own instincts in the beginning, focusing mostly on unsung but potent works. The first week, I've pretty much settled on Julian Haynes' <em>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</em> followed by (in no particular order) Schumpeter's <em>Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</em>, Feyerabend's <em>Against Method</em>, Hutton's <em>Race and the Third Reich</em> and Nassim Taleb's growing corpus, typically called <em>Incerto</em>.</p>

<p>I'm also open to having non-book based topics or perhaps talking about fiction works. Say, the works of Lovecraft or Dick or Borgres.
Now this isn't supposed to be a bookclub, or a learning experience for me though. I want to focus on works and topics I've been familiar with for years, otherwise it would be pretty silly to put out content.
It would sort of like those people who do \"distro\" reviews after playing around on a Linux distro for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>In a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkgeFi4PwOg\">new vid</a>, I talk about the importance of good design, and what that means in your typical shell script. I take the example of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/blob/master/.scripts/shortcuts.sh\">shortcut-sync script</a> I use to keep my bash, ranger and qutebrowser aliases synced and autogenerated. Originally when I wrote it, it was terribly designed, looping through a file and outputting to files six different times per line, adding up for a staggeringly long 1.5 second runtime for a 45 line script! The newer, better version (see the above link to Github), uses streams in the proper way to produce nearly instantaneous completion.</p>

<p>It's a pretty good example of how good (or bad) design principles can add up hugely on a system. It's almost mind-boggling to think about the difference that well-written and efficient code can make even for typical users as you add up the hundres of thousand or millions of lines of code we end up running every day.</p>

<p>A lot of people will repeat the typical mantra that we \"need more programmers\" for the modern economy. I have to say I've always hugely disagreed with this. A lot of the effort spent in the industry is maintaining the unmaintainable and playing whack-a-mole with the problems that bad design creates. We'd be better off with a smaller contingency of programmers and tweakers mindful of efficiency and machine resources.

<p>For a while I had been looking for a command to pause all mpv video instances on my computer. I have a lock script which, while locking, automatically pauses the audio from my mpd, but I had wanted a way to pause all mpv instances as well, otherwise I would have to do the potentially annoying task of getting to the right workspace and hitting pause manually. I could find a lot more \"complicated\" solutions where you have to start mpv on a particular socket, but I ran across a much easier and universal possibility:</p>

<code>xdotool search --class mpv | xargs -I % xdotool key --window % comma</code>

<p>Which is a pretty funny command, but works exactly how I want. If you're not familiar with xdotool, this one-liner just searchs for all <code>mpv</code> instances and sends the key <code>,</code> to each of them, which by default moves the video back by a frame and pauses it.
So now I've just added this line to my lock script, so if I ever am watching something and want to leave my computer and lock it, I don't have to worry about manually pausing mpv which may be on another screeen.
Also, while I've always had <code>Super+p</code> mapped to \"pause/unpause mpd audio\", I've mapped <code>Super+Shift+P</code> to \"pause mpd and all mpv instances\", running this one-liner along with the true mpd pause command.

<p>Holy crap, I've probably installed and reinstalled LARBS 50 times in the past couple days as I've ironed out the last kinks. I've totally rewritten <code>larbs.sh</code> twice (arguably three times) this week, but the result is fantastic.
The script runs smoother than ever on the user side (a full installation takes less than 10 minutes now) and I've autistically separated the code into functions for portability and customizeability.</p>

<p>And boy is it.
Aside from the script now being composed of easy to manipulate functions, <code>larbs.sh</code> now reads in a separate programs file (in .csv format) and can take a custom dotfiles repo as well.
You can feed it a .csv like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS/blob/master/progs.csv\">this one</a> and it can parse the list and install the programs in whatever way it needs to.
E.g. in the setup now, untagged programs are in the main repo, programs tagged with <code>A</code> are AUR programs and <code>G</code> programs are git repositories installable with <code>make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</code>. Depending on the tag, LARBS will run a different install command as needed.
Note that the last column (which is a description of the program in a verb phrase) appears at runtime to describe the program while it's installed.
A nice little addition.

<p>When you have a single-user system, or one with only one user with sudoer access, I always used to hate that every time I became root, I'd lose the settings set in my bashrc and aliases, my vimrc and preferred directory shortcuts.
About 6 months ago, I had the crazy idea to change the root user's home directory from <code>/root</code> to <code>/home/luke</code> so root would look in my main directory for all its dotfiles.</p>

<p>I was initially worried that this could cause some vulnerabilities, it might still, but I have to say that it's been <b>hugely</b> convenient and hasn't given me any problems in all these months, so I recommend trying it out. All you have to do is open <code>/etc/passwd</code> and change the directory on the line starting with <code>root:</code> to your typical home directory.</p>

<p>So whenever you log in as root, you'll still have access to all your rc settings, and will be in your familiar home folder.
I didn't think of it before, but you'll also have fewer log files to have to sort through.
For example, if I once worked out a compilcated shell command and am trying to look it up in my <code>.bash_history</code>, I used to have to check <code>/home/luke/.bash_history</code> <em>and</em> <code>/root/.bash_history</code> if I couldn't remember if I ran it as myself or root.
Now, however, both accounts use the same history file for bash, and also other programs.</p>

<p>So anyway, I recommend trying it out. I'm sure I'll get a couple emails about how it could be potentially dangerous, but the convenience has been huge and I've had no problems, although I might not recommend doing this on your webserver to hedge against unknown vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>One of the strangest turns-of-phrase that Apple has tried to hoist on the public is the term \"PC\" to mean all non-Apple computers.
Even without delving much deeper, this is one of the most bizarre choices; Apple Mac computers are not just PCs, but they were arguably <em>the first</em> PCs&mdash;you would think that Apple would be proud of more or less inventing the idea of a Personal Computer.</p>

<p>Regardless, what is the <em>point</em> of the term PC to Apple advertising? Why did they run that classic series of commercials contrasting Macs and \"PCs\"?
At a basic level, PC is just a catch-all exonym, that is, a term for all computers outside of a designated group.
In reality, there's really nothing common to computers made by Lenovo, Dell, Asus and every other company that aren't also held in common with Apple computers.
The only thing in common, at least, is the <em>lack</em> of the characteristic Apple weirdness (no other company is going to get rid of all their computers' important ports, for example).</p>

<p>Regardless, I noticed the actual public relations use of the term \"PC\" after I did my video on Macs&mdash;this term works wonders in the mind of an Mac fan.
That is, nearly every dogmatic Apple user would call me a \"PC fanboy\"!
<em>PC fanboy...</em> what could that possibly mean?</p>

<p>At first I thought most hate mail was coming from people who didn't watch 10 or so seconds in when I said that I used Linux (deliberately to avoid inane comments like this).
I assumed that \"PC\" meant \"a machine running Windows\", which is clearly not what Mac-users thought the term to mean: it was <em>all</em> non-Mac computers. I'd guess that my old TI-84 calculator is a \"PC\" by that metric.
This is a total inversion of what the term \"fanboy\" means of course. You can be a Mac fanboy: Apple Mac products, while sometimes different, all share the exact same design principles and are all owned by one company notorious for its quasi-cult like public relations.</p>

<p>While on the other hand, \"PC fanboy\" doesn't really mean anything&mdash;there's no common denominator or design or principle behind all non-Apple computers (again, aside from the fact that they don't do the manifestly stupid things that Apple does).
A \"PC fanboy\" in practice just means someone who doesn't like Macs, but that's where the magic is for Apple advertising&mdash;Mac users have always been lampooned as cult members, but the term PC is an attempt redirect the claims of irrational devotion backwards.
It doesn't have to make sense generally, but it makes sense in the head of an Apple fanboy: non-Mac computers are all the same and if you don't like Macs, you must just have some terrible emotional problem with them for no reason (this is the gist of most of the hatemail I get on this anyway).</p>

<p>Since I made my video on Macs, I don't dislike Macs any more than I did before, but I am continually losing respect for Mac users.
I could've just as easily done a video on why I don't use Windows, but God knows that Windows users don't have the same genre of pathological attachment to the brand they use.
That's not to imply that all comments from Mac users even disagreed with me, but the vocal members of the hivemind have certainly put a smug anime girl face on me from time to time.

While there is a patch for st 0.7 which gives it sixel compatibility, due to its *le bloat* it hasn't been accepted into the program, and aside from that, I don't think ranger is built to work with sixel itself either so far.
Either way, I still consider st largely \"the best\", but being able to patch in something like this would make it closer to \"perfect\". With the features and bindings I have in my build, I find it a little sad when I have to use another terminal.</p>

<p>If you keep up with my random asides in videos and elsewhere, you might know that I'm extremely disappointed with the current state of institutionalized science.
The post-war era was a disaster for scientific epistemology, in fact, epistemology and science commentary mostly became an exercise to exclude one's enemies by technicality.
Academia became an enormous state-funded enterprise, and the best way to ensure that your research program got funding before your rivals was to develop advanced reasoning to exclude their methodology altogether from science.
</p>

<p>Thus the term \"pseudoscience\".
In former centuries, there was no such division between \"science\" and \"pseudoscience\".
Researchers wrote tomes on subjects which were amalgams of hard analysis and what we would now consider baseless or unwarranted speculation.
Each were understood for what they were, all ideas were on the table for analysis.
</p>

<p>The thing is, all academics&mdash;at least all remotely intelligent ones&mdash;quietly harbor fringe beliefs.
If you push any of them in private, or with vindicating evidence, they'll quickly bounce to support their deeper intuition.
One example that comes to mind is geologist Robert Schoch, who after a little empirical prodding, became a vocal supporter of the idea of a prehistoric dating of the Sphinx, and then later other Mesolithic civilizations.
Nowadays he brushes shoulders even with the ancient aliens crowd, and why shouldn't he?
Once you've earned the designation of \"pseudoscientist\", you might as well go full-bore and have fun.

<p>The other best-kept secret is that by definition, \"pseudoscience\" drives advancement in \"real science\".
All new ideas start out as baseless speculation&mdash;Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift, based on the trivial and child-like realization that South America sort of fits into Africa, was mocked as pseudoscientific by Americans for decades. Now it's science.
I wouldn't doubt if Schoch's Sphinx water erosion hypothesis will be similarly vindicated, partially by the many Mesolithic constructions found since then.
</p>

<p>
In linguistics and archeology, we have a recent \"pseudoscientist\" in Marija Gimbutas.
Gimbutas unearthed many female idols/dolls from pre-Indo-European Europe and jumped to far-reaching, \"pseudoscientific\" conclusions: Old Europe was a feminist utopia, there was no violence and complete harmony, etc.
Because Gimutas's politics were socially unassailable, you don't hear \"pseudoscientist\" around her much, but that's certainly the word on everyone's lips.
If pseudoscience is what Schoch is doing, it's certainly what she was doing.
Regardless, this pushed her into making specific claims about the origin of Indo-Europeans, that they originated from the Kurgan (Yamnaya) culture, a claim that has now become consensus due to further archeological, linguistic and nowadays even genetic research.
</p>

<p>
I've seen first hand that there are really two types of personalities in science.
On one had, there's the conventional and petty academic who is \"detail-oriented\" and \"rigorous\" in some sense that means religiously adherent to theoretical priors.
These people will only truly fight for something when they're on the side of consensus or when the issue is of no social importance.
On the other side are the \"pseudoscientists\", or in other words, the people who actually have something interesting to say.

<p>I took a long (several hour) walk to clear my head this morning, and came back to a pleasant surprise: YouTube has finally (after five or six months of review) monetized my channel.
I don't have the slightest idea how much money I'll actually end up getting from this, but I hope it's decent enough.
</p>

<p>
Of course, my studious core of viewers all will be using ad-blockers. The one I usually recommend is <a href=\"https://adnauseam.io/\">Ad Nauseam</a>, which is not just a blocker, but a dazzler. If you don't like ads, don't feel like you need to permit them from my channel to get me more revenue. I'm sure there are plenty other who will be watching them without.
I only monetized after polling my audience at the old forum (some 80% just told me to monetize) and if you're part of that remaining 20%, just block them as you usually would.
</p>

<p>The other nice detail is that I can now allow \"Super Chats\" in livestreams.
If you don't know, that's when users can pay money to have their chat message plastered prominently in the chat window for a period proprtional to their donation.
I think chats in my livestreams are off decent enough size that people would be willing to get some of these.
But then again, now doing le bloodsports seems like a much more appealling prospect. Any takers?

YouTube is terrible about showing older videos to users, so it's nice having <em>my own</em> archive of things displayed logically.

For all they complain about there being a drought of advertisers, they put out all the incentives for people to put out more and more junk videos constantly.

<p>I've still been looking for apartments in Georgia or thereabout and yesterday I took a full-day trip back to Athens (Georgia of course) to scout out apartments. After a full day and after seeing about a dozen places, I have to admit that I didn't find anywhere too much up to snuff, even given the fact that I don't need to be particularly close to the university.</p>

<p>I may be back there again within a week or so, but I'll concede that I was debating whether I actually want to live there again.
I'm really not in the mood to put down a year's rent anywhere, even if it's only $5000 or so, unless I can get a really great place, but I suppose the real problem is a change in my mindset.</p>

<p>In brief, I don't feel like I want to put down money for something that isn't going to last; the bugmanhood of renting an apartment is extremely unappealing.
The better alternative now seems like just buying a parcel of land with the little money I've saved up.
My goal is 5+ semi-remote acres for less than $20,000, which is doable. I have a couple placing I'm looking at now, but am always looking for more.
I just want land that I am extremely free in building restrictions and zoning (preferable none), and that I can have a permanent setup on: possible growing and self-sustaining utilities.
I've done a lot of math and think that I can get a decent cabin built (my myself) for less than $5,000, probably closer to $3,000, but maybe with $2,000 of unforeseen costs ;-)</p>

<p>The other thing on the ledger would be me buying a car (or more likely, a pick-up) because I haven't needed a car since honestly 10 years (my old car finally died about two years ago).
Granted, if anyone reading this around Georgia has a used pickup truck in good shape they're willing to get rid of, feel free to contact me ;-)
Don't rip me off though, I have a YouTube channel!

<p>First, as a reminder, I do indeed have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://patreon.com/lukesmith\">a Patreon</a> and encourage people to join. As stiff of a veneer I pretend to have when it comes to money, I won't pretend that there is a great psychological effect to getting new patrons and bigger pledges. Now that I'm dissertating, if I can start making decent money on YouTube, it will affect a lot how much free time I'll have if I can live with on part-time work. If you don't like Patreon as a platform, donate via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://liberapay.com/LukeSmith\">Liberapay</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://paypal.me/lukemsmith\">Paypal</a>.</p>

<p>I said so a couple days ago in a part of another post, but I'm switching my Patreon to being based \"by creation\" rather than \"by month\" so people get charged by content rather than time. As longer viewers know, sometimes I have to take several weeks off, while other times, I'm making videos every day.
<b>If you're already a patron on Patreon, you might want to change your settings.</b>
Specifically, everyone has been grandfathered in from the monthly donation scheme with those settings.
If you want to pledge by creation now, you'll have to adjust the per unit donation and your maximum.  </p>

<p>Of course <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://liberapay.com/LukeSmith\">my Liberapay</a> is, by its nature set to on a weekly basis, so if you want a clearer time-based donation system, try them out. Liberapay, unlike Patreon, does not skim money off the top for themselves, so if you're thinking about using one of them for time-based donations and don't have any account yet, go with Liberapay.</p>

<p>By the way, Patreon says I'm making $180 per video, which isn't accurate. It's really more like $180 per month plus about $10 or so for the first few videos; it simply adds in the monthly donators to that number. If I could actually make near $200 per video or more, I could basically retire and do this full time ;-).</p>

<p>After a good bit more reading, I've given up on <em>Hamlet's Mill</em>, and not lightly. I usually view it as a kind of shame to stop reading a book before finishing, but I frankly don't feel like it's worth it at this point. The book is far too circumambulative to actually communicate its deeper point, but I get the feeling that it's that way out of a desire on the authors' part to avoid criticism with lack of clarity.</p>

<p>From what I can gather (after reading several hundred pages of deep, dank, quasi-poetic prose), it's a general argument that many classic mythological stories (those stories in different cultures that <em>Hamlet</em> is based on) are a kind of folkloric embedding of knowledge of axial procession (the fact that the earth's axis wobbles every several tens of thousands of years). This point is only alluded to or barely said, and only very circumstantial arguments are made for it, at the request of readers to squint their eyes to blurry the argument to make it sound more convincing than it really is.</p>

<p>Instead, I've started reading Julian Jaynes' <em>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</em> for the third time. It's one of my favorite reads, no so much because I find it so convincing, but because it's that pleasurable mix of ancient aliens-tier imagination and speculation with at least passable science, neurology, linguistics and other research. This was an enjoyment I hoped to replicate in reading <em>Hamlet's Mill</em> actually.</p>

<p>I've been hinted that I might start doing book reviews at the request of many subscribers, and I might pick <em>Bicameral Mind</em> to be the first candidate after I finish it again. I put up a poll of commonly requested books on the forum, and Taleb's <em>Antifragile</em>, Herrnstein and Murray <em>Bell Curve</em> and an unspecified book by Nietzsche got the most votes, but I'll probably end up doing everything on the poll anyway.</p>

<p>A week or so ago, I heard about, for the first time, the book <em>Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and Its Transmission Through Myth</em>. The subtitle should communicate the gist. After ordering it online, it arrived this afternoon and I've gotten five chapters in (barely a fifth of the way through the whole thing).</p>

<p>I was attracted to the book as part of my general sympathy for the idea that pre-classical and primeval knowledge and myth is, to use a silly word <em>scientific</em>, or at least true in a astronomical or quasi-metaphorical level. That's certainly the intended argument of the book, but it certainly labors under that Moldbuggian tendency to beat around the bush quietly, hoping that the deeper argument will eventually sneak up and hit its reader on the head. While the book is definitely designed to be a slow burn, one positive aspect is authors' repeated insistence of the imperfectness of translating early writings and myths, partially on linguistic grounds, but even more so due to the severely underestimated difference between the modern and primeval mindset.</p>

<p>I'll also say that in addition to this book, I've also bought <em>Pandora's Seed</em> (Spencer Wells) and the notable <em>Forbidden Archaeology</em> (Michael Cremo), both of which I'll hopefully be going through this week. The latter book I bought with not too much expectation of seriousness, but out of raw curiosity. It argues an extremely ancient origin of mankind based on reinterpretation of archaeological evidence, its author being what could be described as a Vedic Creationist. I don't expect to be convinced or even unannoyed by the book, but I'm always interested in circumstantial evidence for an earlier date for human evolution, especially given the constant pushing back of the accepted date.</p>

<li>There actually were some girls Linuxfest (although no obvious <font color=\"green\">&gt;girls</font>).</li>
<li>My talk was pretty crowded; standing room only. It also generated a lot of good discussion. I polled the audience and about half of them knew me (usually the younger ones).</li>
<li>Some boomer guy began to unironically \"Interject\" to my use of the term \"Linux\" as I used it in the talk ;-)</li>
<li>I even had a very young fan (as in utterly prepubescent fan) besting even Pewdiepie's fans in youth. He asked for an autograph and picture.</li>
<li>Linuxfest was generally well-organized but there were some huge oversights. The rooms were only equipped to handle HDMI inputs. This basically ruined Michael Tunnell's presentation which was right before mine (and probably others) since they couldn't record from his laptop. Poor guy had to use some useless Chromebook (which its distinct lack of keys) to try to preview kdenlive. They couldn't record from mine either, but I'm not going to let that happen, so I just went Harambe Mindframe and connected to the screen VGA input, bypassing their recording rig and recorded the talk on my own machine. This is something that the speakers should not have to be worrying about.</li>
<li>People got a little peeved by the organizer's keynote, because it went way, way over on time, and then was followed by another talk that ruffled some vocal SJW feathers (basically a critique of witch-hunting codes of conduct). This is just what I gleamed from people, all of whom were really tired after a long day, because I sat these talks out.</li>

<p>While I'm looking for a new apartment or land to live on, I've been living in the Atlanta suburbs (or 'boondocks' in some people's definitions) again. After a couple days of rest after the grueling move/drive across country, I'm getting used to the 40 minute walk to the closest town and the extreme lack of people of my demographics (both age and race).</p>

<p>I found a local bookstore today and bought a copy of Cochran and Harpending's <em>The 10,000 Year Explosion</em>, a book I had read a while ago, but never bought. It's actually my style to only buy books after reading them and liking them at libraries. I'm rereading it now.</p>

<p>Friendship ended with Arizona; now Georgia is my best friend.</p>

<p>I just finished my move from Arizona, which is more relieving than I can possibly express. Classwork is done, and the only possible reason I'll ever be returning to that quite literal hell-hole is for when I defend my dissertation and my graduation ceremony.</p>

<p>The thing is, while I've moved from Arizona, I haven't really moved anywhere in particular; I'll be living with family and friends until I decided where I want to live exactly. Here are my options:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Just go full innawoods right now, buy land (in Georgia or Tennessee) with my money and get started. The disadvantage is that I don't have as much money as I'd like to get a choice parcel, and this would also interfere with my dissertation (perhaps it doesn't matter of course).</li>
    <li>Partial innawoods. I have some family in Florida with remote land and farmhouses. I could ask to live their and watch the property, maybe practice for real innawoods hours in the meantime. No money required other than my food, unless the relevant family member wants nominal rent.</li>
    <li>Move to an apartment in a practical place to work on my dissertation. This would probably mean a college town where they have a library and bus system (probably Athens, where the University of Georgia is, where I've lived before and have friends, but I don't particularly like the place). Work on the dissertation and finish in a year, then go elsewhere.</li>
    <li>Move into Atlanta, get an internship at an NGO, become a bugman (joke choice).</li>
</ul>

<p>Other data:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I don't own a car anymore and don't want to buy one unless I go innawoods. I'll need a truck if I do. Having a car while living in a city is a waste.</li>
    <li>I'll <em>possibly</em> still be getting some amount of money from the University of Arizona for online work. This means that I'll have an income stream. I want to treat this income as going directly into the innawoods fund though.</li>
    <li>If I actually ever get monetized (it's been 5 months of \"review\"), I might actually be making workable money on YouTube (possibly enough for rent somewhere). Patreon/Paypal is small now, but a lot more than nothing and sort of pays for my groceries and such.</li>

<p>One request I get a whole lot is to talk about how to learn a language, or one harder, a language using only a book. I could just \"talk\" about it, but I figure doing it real time might be a lot better. I taught myself Latin this way nearly 10 years ago, and now use my Latin knowledge all the time academically. Part of my knowledge of Chinese also comes from my particular method of learning.</p>

<p>Anyway, I want to record myself going through an introductory language-learning book, verbally externalize my thoughts to make it clear how I interpret what I see. Obviously I have a lot of initial knowledge about languages generally, but as it comes up, I'll mention and explain all the needed concept  and why they're relevant.</p>

<p>The language I've chosen to learn is Old Norse/Old Icelandic, which, as it happens, is very close and mutually intelligible with modern Icelandic with some minor differences. WhyOld Norse? (1) It's an ancient language that can be useful for my own understanding of historical linguistics, and the development of Germanic languages, (2) it still has some older linguistic properties that will keep viewers informed of a more highly inflected language, but (3) it also has a vocabulary similar to English, which will minimize the rote memorization aspect of learning it.</p>

There is a built in system (with control-k) for inputting special characters, but it's not as manipulatable as I'd like. Instead, I have two little vim files that coin functions to enable/disable deadkeys (for diacritics) or extra shortcuts for characters in the International Phonetic Alphabet.</p>

<p>The deadkey function turns ', \", :, ` and other symbols into deadkeys that place diacritics onto different characters. The IPA function is similar, but allows a sequence of semicolon plus two letters to correspond to an IPA symbol. E.g., if I want to type 'ʃ', I just type ';sh.</p>

<p>The links are in the video description (the files are in the voidrice repository as usual). The system is pretty customizable, and you can easily add whatever characters you need, potentially imitating the toggling commands I have there already.</p>

<p>For the past day or so, I've been \"writing\" a blog \"system\". Really it's only about 100 lines in shell script, which sure as hell beats installing WordPress and having huge databases on the server.</p>

<p>I want to have one rolling blog page, automatic RSS feed updates and maybe even standalone pages, so that's what I wrote. I also want to be able to link to individual blog entries on the rolling page, so I have it automatically label each header for the use of interior urls.</p>

<p>If you're reading this, wherever you're reading it, it's been successfuly.</p>

<p>Really all the script does is let you write a HTML draft entry, and when you're done, it appends it to the rolling page and converts its information into an RSS feed entry and appends it to your RSS feed. \"Append\" is probably the wrong word though, since it's not being added to the end, but in front of other entries.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope to be able to have a fully functioning and synced blog and RSS feed, without the hassle or bloat, now I'm pretty confident that I'm right about at it. The only thing I haven't implemented (and might not) is the ability to change and delete posts from the RSS/rolling blog/standalone page directory.

<p>So I'm actually using a Namecheap VPS now, which is the registrar of my domains anyway. I thought this would make transferring my hosting easy (It wasn't). Namecheap has atrocious documentation and their site is extremely slow and non-responsive (thankfully their hosting servers/VPSs aren't). Regardless, I've gotten my website working (with https) and my email with their email service after several days of making DNS changes blindly and checking the results on update 24 hours later.</p>

While there are tools like Let's Encrypt, they can often be a pain to get working with different hosts and especially when you're like me and want wildcard certificates for your multiple sites.

We've run into each other in the halls from time to time, but this was the first time we officially spoke. This sounds like a somewhat bloggish thing to mention, and knowing me, I felt no overwhelming need to speak with him, but Tom Bever insisted on introducing us.</p>

<p>Tom introduced me in too glowing terms, a nice, yet not so meaningful gesture considering Noam is more than half deaf nowadays, especially in the bustle of the party. People had actually be lining up to see him; it looked sort of like people paying respect to a mafia don, but Tom unceremoniously pushed aside everyone else and invited me to talk to Noam directly.</p>

<p>We spoke a bit about my projects on prosodically driven syntax and the quantifier scope project, and he entreated me to talk to him later to get more in depth. He didn't divulge if he knew about me, granted, he's definitely heard of me from Tom and others in the department and we've spoken on email chains, but I'm not sure what or if he could've been expected to remember considering that he's less involved than the other faculty.</p>

<p>I still don't plan on going into the field, but there was an aura of momentousness to the event. A couple people were taking pictures of us and I got a couple comments afterward that remarked on the potential significance of our first meeting.</p>

<p>Either way it is sort of funny. Someone mentioned to me a bit ago that a lot of the grad students in the field know Arizona as \"the place where Luke Smith is\", which is hilarious for many reasons, and would probably be upsetting for a lot of the syntacticians here, but most strange now that Noam is here (a lot of people assume he's still at MIT since it's only been a year or so). I've never been plugged into academic politics, I don't actually plan on publishing before I leave the field and I've never even been to the LSA, but between the YouTube channel and targeted pressure from several people, I have a level of notoriety unexpected by me.</p>

<p>So the disaster scenario for \"some people out there\" is that something comes of this: that I become in the popular eye \"the Linguist\" that at least some normal people know about, or even worse, some kind of next logical step from Chomsky, catapulted to prominence in a way similar to how Noam's political rabble-rousing popularized him. And of course the elephant in the room is the political differences: there's a huge irony in some kind of mantle being passed from a Jewish anarcho-communist who grew up on a kibbutz to a goyish low-church Borderer who voted for Trump and has only barely managed to slip into the cracks of academia given his political disposition. If I were to obtain a well-known position in academia, I would be doing a lot of good for the re-enfranchisement of the White Right in the opinion-molding class.</p>

<p>That's not to say that my ascendancy in the field is even probable if I do stay, but the mere fact there's greater than a 2% chance of it would certainly have surprised me 15, 10, 5 or even 2 years ago. The only question is what aspects of my life am I willing to give up to continue to stoke the fires of this potentiality, or if I can continue to tolerate this lifestyle. On one hand, I've put up with every lie, manipulation, character assassination and \"technicality\" that could be thrown at me from this department, mostly without flinching, and my detractors are starting to sound like boys-who-cried-wolfs. On the other hand, a cabin for my family in the woods generally sounds like a better lifestyle.</p>

The problem with nearly all web browsers is that it's pretty hard and annoying to put together \"dotfiles\" for them, a default profile that has sensible defaults.

Brave is especially nice because it comes with add-ons that block adds, redirect to HTTPS and add Tor and torrenting capabilities.

Bad/limited add-ons/extensions.</li>
<li>Icecat &ndash; I'll admit it, two years, Icecat was absolutely unusable on pretty much all sites, but it looks like it's evened most everything out.

<li>qutebrowser &ndash; I haven't used it in years and I don't know if I want to get back into figuring it out for the third time, lol. I don't know where it is nowadays, but if I'm making normies use it, it's going to have to be able to play YouTube videos and without 400% CPU usage. qutebrowser does have the _massive_ advantage of __actually having dotfiles__ so I can easily change defaults.</li>
<li>Waterfox &ndash; Well, a better form of Firefox on most fronts, but Bing is the default search engine.</li>

<p>As I've said before, I saw thinking of making LARBS compatible with both i3-gaps and dwm.
Both of them have their advantages: i3 is much more easy for newbs (and non-newbs, and non-weebs for that matter) to customize, while dwm's master and slave layout is pretty hard for me to give up despite the fact that its default statusbar is atrocious and comes with the non-unfounded fragility of some suckless applications.</p>
<p>On a whim, I decided to play around with bspwm over this weekend, and I've got to say that it has a lot of both... or really, it is so customizable that it can be extended to both.</p>
<p>
If you don't know anything about bspwm,
I'll direct you to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLZbk1-wwVA\">a video by Wolfgang on bspwm, specifically comparing it with i3</a>
(Although my informants tell me he is a GNOME-cuck or something nowadays or something ;-)&mdash;maybe I should try that?)
</p>
<p>bspwm, unlike i3 and dwm is just a raw window manager (WM): it does not even have a unique status bar or keybinding system: you are expected to use a modular bar of your own choosing and a binding program like sxhkd to map what you need.</p>
<p>My setup is modular enough, in that I already have sxhkd for most my binds, including many scripts and even statusbar scripts that the change-over has been pretty quick.
If I feel like bspwm is more stable and can get everything I want from i3 and everything I want for dwm, I might use it for good.
</p>
<p>I've also dusted off the old polybar config, which I had barely modified before... and I've begun to add new modules, like those I made for i3blocks (which again is a pretty simple process due to the modularity of both).

As I always say, it's not a cabin, but a full house, but this does mean pretty significant lifestyle changes for me and a new page for the channel as well. As I said in the video, I might not be able to easily upload videos for a short while until I get settled, but here are some updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've moved my stuff to the house and am now going through a life's worth of papers, tools, books, furniture and everything else trying to decorate my house. In addition to my own stuff, there's a lot of furniture and other accouterments that came with the house and there is even more that my dad has been keeping in a nearby shed for extra storage. I'm collocating and organizing all of this</li>
<li>I have more room than I've ever had, as you would hope. I have three (or depending on how you count four) bedrooms, one of which I'll be using as an office/studio. It will be nice for insomnia's sake to keep my electronics (which are internetless anyway) away from being a distraction in bed!</li>
<li>I also have lots of land that I need to fully assess. My relative who lived here before didn't have so much of a garden, but did plant and maintain several useful plants (although some I don't even know!). There are definitely unattended grape plants/vines and some fruit-bearing trees.?</li>
<li>It will be a day or two more before I'm done sorting all my stuff indoors and in the garage/workshop, but after that, the priority is making a garden. Many, including many of you suggested using raised beds, and I think I've decided to try them. It might be late to plant some things, but the growing season this far south is long, so I'll be consulting with some of my growing guides and people around for best practices.</li>
<li>My internet is truly bad! I haven't even tried to upload videos yet, but text-based and (small) image based browsing is okay. Videos will buffer and will take a bit with youtube-dl. Luckily, I've designed my computer usage over minimizing bandwidth use for a day like this, but I still need to upload videos. I'll figure out the best way to do this soon. I also am going to need to get into the crawlspace to run an ethernet cord to my new office.</li>
<li>I get no cell service in my house, and am further thinking of getting rid of my cell phone forever. There are other providers with better coverage here though, but I think I might go max-Boomer and just get a landline which obviously is infinitely more reliable.</li>
<li>It was sad leaving my friends in Statesboro, but I will be going back at some point soon (there of course are things I left behind ;-) and other chores to do). It is nice all the things I do avoid here: like Zoomers blasting that Kanye/Lil Pump song every night at the club across the street. Won't miss that.</p>

	<li>It will be a day or two more before I'm done sorting all my stuff indoors and in the garage/workshop, but after that, the priority is making a garden. Many, including many of you suggested using raised beds, and I think I've decided to try them. It might be late to plant some things, but the growing season this far south is long, so I'll be consulting with some of my growing guides and people around for best practices.</li>
	<li>My internet is truly bad! I haven't even tried to upload videos yet, but text-based and (small) image based browsing is okay. Videos will buffer and will take a bit with youtube-dl. Luckily, I've designed my computer usage over minimizing bandwidth use for a day like this, but I still need to upload videos. I'll figure out the best way to do this soon. I also am going to need to get into the crawlspace to run an ethernet cord to my new office.</li>
	<li>I get no cell service in my house, and am further thinking of getting rid of my cell phone forever. There are other providers with better coverage here though, but I think I might go max-Boomer and just get a landline which obviously is infinitely more reliable.</li>
	<li>It was sad leaving my friends in Statesboro, but I will be going back at some point soon (there of course are things I left behind ;-) and other chores to do). It is nice all the things I do avoid here: like Zoomers blasting that Kanye/Lil Pump song every night at the club across the street. Won't miss that.</p>

It's possible (probable?) that there will be some breakage (now and soon) because there are a lot of moving pieces that have moved around.
Here are the changes coming soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be a new version of LARBS, which will eventually be the default if everything works smoothly.
I will maintain the current version for Arch Linux using i3-gaps, but I will be adding another version for <strong>Void Linux that runs dwm</strong>.
</li>
<li>Reflecting some of the movements to mutal compatibility I moved keybinds from the main i3 config to <code>~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc</code> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ClckQzJTlk\">as I discussed in my video today</a>) and moved some startup scripts to <code>~/.xinitrc</code>.</li>
<li><code>~/.scripts/</code> in the repo is now <code>~/.local/bin/</code> to be XDG compliant and save you one extra element in your home directory.</li>
<li>I've moved things around in <a href=\"https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/larbs\">the LARBS repository</a> as well, and this could interfere with the <a href=\"https://larbs.xyz\">LARBS website</a> and how it redirects requests, but everything seems to be in order.</li>
</ul>
<p>So every one of these developments bode well, but all can cause temporary breakage!
If you run into a problem install LARBS, you will not be bothering me to email it to me.
I would appreciate people to test it if you have a spare machine/VM as well, but I'm a little burdened right now.
I'll be testing in a bit.</p>

<p>I'm going to start offering elite stuff to donators:
<ul>

	<li>I've started a Mumble server, which allows people to talk to me directly via audio and text. People who donate $10 a month will get access to it.</li>
	<li>I'll be starting a \"Dispatches from the Unaboomer's Cabin\" series, covering my ongoing quest to move /innawoods/. The first episode(s) will go up at least by early next week. Donate $25 in a month to see the updates.</li>
	<li>People who are chad enough to donate $50 a month will get all that stuff, and also an invitation onto the livestream. So we can talk live on air and you can move the discussion without me brushing aside your $2 superchat ;-).</li>
	<li>There are many unreleased videos I've had over the years or other content that is more private or just not necessarily YouTube material. I'll be making a lot of one-off stuff available to different tiers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/lukesmith\" target=\"_blank\">Go to Patreon to join now.</a> The Mumble passwords will be up in a couple days (actually maybe later today if everything goes right).
</p>

<p>
If you don't have or don't want to get a Patreon, if you say you want one of the perks in the comment of a Paypal or Zelle donation (be sure to include your email too), I will give you that month's password.
<a href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/donate.html\">All donation methods are listed here.</a>
That's a little more work for me though, so Patreon is preferred at this point.
</p>

<p>I'll also say what I did in the Patreon post: I am looking at some open source equivalents to Patreon that can be run on my own server.

<p>You know what, I released yet another video today, this one on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czUp-MvWvE\">\"\"\"rationality\"\"\"</a> or at least on how the term is clumsily understood.
</p>

<p>
I have a lot of videos slated for release soon and I honestly forgot about this one today, I suppose in conjunction with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/blog/new-git-repo-greek-septuagintnew-testament-on-the-command-line.html\">my last post</a>, this constitutes a bad day for all Reddit-tier fedorafriends out there!
</p>

<p>I talk about the limits to how people commonly misunderstand rationality and how we often find ourselves in destructive logical holes when we too blindly assume that the straight-jacket of formal logic corresponds to the world out there.</p>

<p>To go a little more in depth, check out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://notrelated.libsyn.com/when-youre-too-rational-to-be-rational\">one of my recent podcast episodes on the same topic</a>.

<code>kjv-git</code> can return any (English) King James Version Bible verse, series of verses or whole book at your command, but there is no obvious equivalent in Greek or Hebrew.
This is an annoyance because for anyone like me who occasionally needs a Bible verse or the original wording of a passage, you have to open up a browser and search for it in a bloated website written by a Soydev.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this morning since I was skipping church for highly justified reasons, I forked the repository and painstakingly found and rearranged a plaintext Greek Septuagint (i.e. the Old Testament) and the SBL Greek New Testament so that they could be read by the same system.
Took a lot of regexing, but you can get it for yourself here: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/grb\">https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/grb</a>.
Many Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical books are included if you like the Bible: Expanded Universe.

I went to visit some family land by the river, which had been partially flooded with some residual marshland.

I didn't mention it yesterday, but the \"urbanization\" of the area is somewhat jarring.
I mean \"urbanization\" in the loosest sense (I'm not quite sure what to call it, perhaps \"commercialization\"), but a lot of the small towns in the area have started to produce Subways, McDonalds, chain gas stations and even a couple of Walmarts.
The essence of the area hasn't changed that much, but it could mean the beginning of a potentially irreversable process.

Earlier today I was Booming as usual back home, but I took a long drive to a family area several hundred miles away where I'll probably be for the next week.

Perhaps I'll make some videos or record podcasts or work on my dissertations.
We'll see.

<p>
You often forget, even when you live in a pretty small city what exactly true silence sounds like.
Back where I live now, there is still the constant nightly buzz of Zoomers at the club listening to that damned Kanye/Lil Pump song 6 million times a night.
Here during nightime, however, at first you hear nothing, and only after long exposure do you hear the distant packs of wolves and wild dogs howling at each other, or the bleating of a boar.
When in non-rural areas usually most of what you hear is drowned out as the unimportant mess it is, if you go for a midnight stroll in a dark forest, every sound becomes meaningful, if not alarming. Even as I write this on the porch of the isolated house, a larger animal is rummaging gently in the bush just out of my field of view.
I'm a little unnerved as it seems to be working its way slowly to me, perhaps trying to figure out the clacking of a ThinkPad keyboard and the brightness of the accompanying ThinkLight.

I thought about soiling an earlier night walk by recording a video, but while your eyes adjust to the only light, the moon, a cell phone can hardly make the adjustment and capture the actual appearance of anything, not least by blaring its electronic luminescene on everything.

Give it an images and a location/dimensions for it and it will print it to the terminal.
The preview will survive after multiple resizing, mouse away and anything else.
Much more robust than w3mimg.
</p>
<p>A brief example in bash. I recommend installing ueberzug via pip to ensure all the right dependencies.</p>

ImageLayer
declare -A command=([path]=\"pix/image.png\" [identifier]=\"name\" [action]=\"add\" [x]=\"0\" [y]=\"0\" [max_width]=\"400\" [height]=\"400\")</code></pre>
<p>The above will print <code>pix/image.png</code> in the top left (0x0) and ensure it fits within 400x400 by resizing it.
If you spawn a bunch more windows and move it around, the image is very consistent.
</p>
<p>Now vifm does provide some built-in arguments for the size of the preview window and location, but despite a little tinkering, I couldn't actually get any previews to pop up.
I tried in my build of st, urxvt and alacritty and none worked in vifm.

I could toy around with it a little more and figure it out, but if any of you guys have already done it, feel free to share your script/command to do it.

On that last point, you might want to listen to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://notrelated.libsyn.com/when-youre-too-rational-to-be-rational\">the podcast I did on Gerd Gigerenzer's work</a>, which is related: we, especially psychologists, have this fetish for cargo-cult rationality, often when it leads us to be dumber/bigger chumps IRL.
Taleb is also keenly aware of the sociological aspect of academia, the replication crisis, the wishful thinking and confirmation bias ubiquitous in the soft (i.e. non-) sciences.
Many people will correctly call IQ or <em>g</em> \"the most successful\" finding of psychological sciences in the 20th century.
I say \"correctly\" because everything else psychological \"sciences\" have found is either totally non-reproduceable or the result of smoke-and-mirrors, so, sure IQ is number 1 in a field of continual failure.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, on the topic, a lot of Boomers will deny any potential reality of IQ/g or any other kinds of cognitive tests out of a deep-seated faith in total human cognitive uniformity (otherwise that would make them literally Hitler).
This isn't really Taleb's motivation: his, if I my psychoanalyze for a moment, amounts to a disappointment with the pseudo-rationalist \"funcionary\" thought-patterns that an IQ test favors being celebrated as a cognitive ideal, when in reality these mental habits aren't really so correlated with success outside of bureaucracy.
Taleb certainly loves to dab on n*rds and I support his efforts.
That and a conviction to sound understanding of statistics drive him.
</p>
<p>
Is \"IQ\" <em>utterly meaningless</em>?
No I don't think so, nor do I think Taleb thinks so, but it's only a clumsy and introductory mosaic used to approach human cognitive differences and we shouldn't necessarily treat it as a mentalistic holon without careful caveats.
As he puts it in the above Medium article:
</p>
<blockquote>
\"If you renamed IQ, from \"Intelligent Quotient\" to FQ \"Functionary Quotient\" or SQ \"Salaryperson Quotient\", then some of the stuff will be true. It measures best the ability to be a good slave. \"IQ\" is good for @davidgraeber's \"BS jobs\".\"
</blockquote>
<p>
\"Autism Quotient\" might be another candidate.
IQ shows <em>something</em>, but I think a lot of Taleb's critique comes down to assumption that \"high IQ\" tendencies are not necessarily either good or indicative of intelligence in a meaningful sense.
I think there is a strong correlation between IQ what we intuitively think of as \"intelligence\", but you must take that with Taleb's qualifiers mentioned above and the fact that for some cultural reasons (and pity), we think of autistic shut-ins and losers in high-school as being \"intelligent\" (thus the concept of IQ has affected what we think of as being smart).
In the past, autistic shut-ins were understood to be utter morons and the ideal intelligent person might be an outgoing, socially-aware, but \"irrationally\" cautious, high-agency person with little attention to detail.
If \"IQ\" measured <em>that</em> kind of person, which we could easily do, we would likely find some of the same correlations since like our \"IQ\" it rules out the extremely dull, but such a test might be likely to have better life-performance correlations as well.
</p>
<p>
To sum up, I mostly concur with what Taleb says, but I also don't particularly mind using the term \"IQ\" in the way it's conventionally understood so long as it's not understood as some eternal metric of goodness.
I did speak somewhat about the selection of cognitive ability, measured by IQ in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://notrelated.libsyn.com/the-agricultural-revolution-has-been-a-disaster-for-the-human-race\">one of my other podcasts</a>, but my editorial stance was that that selection was not necessarily \"good\".
Like Taleb says in the quote above, a person with a high IQ tends to be a good functionary, a good cog in the system. Perhaps to slavishly obey social orders one does necessitate some level of real intelligence, but that servile and autistic mentality not what true intelligence causes <em>per se</em>, nor should we celebrate than kind of mindset.
</p>
<p>
If anything Taleb says sounds like gibberish, I recommend you either to read his books (<em>Skin in the Game</em>, <em>Antifragile</em>, etc. etc.) or wait for his next inevitable book which I'm sure will include the IQ discussion.
Taleb has a tendency to put things in superficially coarse phrasing online, but his books are lucid beyond comprehension.

A true ricer is all about making his computer elegant. I'm not. I care about efficiency and do have some minor aesthetic things (like transparency), but these are only to keep me from getting bored out of my mind.

That might sound absurd and pure flex, but check it out; it's very impressive.</p>
<p>But anyway, there are a couple specific reasons I don't use \"the pretty\" polybar:</p>

<li>Related to the above, polybar has a bad tendency to break on the updating/renaming of a library. It's the only package I know of that does this regularly.</li>
<li>Polybar is <em>different</em> from and independent from the typical i3bar and lacks some of its abilities. Honestly one of the things that was the straw that broke the camel's back for me was the fact that you can't easily run a command to toggle/hide polybar. Additionally, you have to get use to restarting polybar on screen refresh and having an extra script for generating in the way you want on multiple monitors.

I hope to go a lot further, while not fundamentally altering the quality or realness of the channel.

This is an upcoming and experimental kind of privacy/freedom-respecting computer that appeals to my non-consumerism and sense of efficiency: it's modular, utterly free/libre from the bottom up and designed with a mostly 3D printable case.
I talked about the EOMA68 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvHUDHqSeuM\">in a video</a>, but haven't yet gotten my hands on one, despite thinking that it represents very positive movements in computer construction.

The \"actual computer\" part is a severable card that is supposed to be hosted in different ports: a laptop shell or a desktop shell, etc.
This reduces redundancy and easily separates the outward shell from the computer itself, both of which can be easily replaced if damaged or obsolete.
The computer card itself actually has pretty unimpressive specs, but this early in the game, that's part of the fun.
It is also lacking some typical ports (last time I did research on it, I don't believe there was an ethernet port, so you'd either need an ethernet adapter or wifi dongle).
These deficiencies are related to the adherence to strict open hardware standards from what I can glean.
</p>
<p>
In the livestream, I raised enough money for the computer card itself (I'll be getting one with Parabola GNU/Linux), but also for the desktop casing and then some.
I'll be buying these soon (together they are $120 and then taxes, etc.).
I'd also like to buy the laptop casing which is either $450-500 depending on whether I can 3D print the parts myself, but we didn't quite raise that much.
If you'd like to see me review the laptop casing as well, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/donate\">please donate</a> and I'll order it too!
Honestly, I'd sort of like to start a crowd funding account just so people can see where there money is going to, I might do that.
Either way, I'll be getting the desktop casing and the computer card before they ship out on February 1st.

I'd also like to buy the laptop casing which is either $450-500 depending on whether I can 3D print the parts myself, but we didn't quite raise that much.
If you'd like to see me review the laptop casing as well, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/donate\">please donate</a> and I'll order it too!
Honestly, I'd sort of like to start a crowd funding account just so people can see where there money is going to, I might do that.
Either way, I'll be getting the desktop casing and the computer card before they ship out on February 1st.
</p>

<p>Of course if you or someone you know is involved with the EOMA68, you could always send me a freebie and that money can go to the project next on the list. 😉</p>

I showcase it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfwerXTCb1c\">here in a new video</a>!
This is less of a gift to me than a gift to everyone who watches my channel because it means that my screencasts will be recorded in full wide 1080p HD, and not the awkward 1680x1050 resolution of the fatt TV monitor I used to use and then mutilated by the resolution requirements of YouTube into 1152x720!
</p>
<p>
You can see from the video (probably if you're watching in 1080p or even less) that the screen and webcam should be a good bit crisper since it's no longer going through that awkward conversion.
On my side, the color of the monitor is also fantastic.
Obviously you can't really see it, but it definitely makes a difference for me.

<p>I want to thank again Henok S. for getting me and the channel the simple yet elegant ThinkVision T2224D monitor!
I showcase it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfwerXTCb1c\">here in a new video</a>!
This is less of a gift to me than a gift to everyone who watches my channel because it means that my screencasts will be recorded in full wide 1080p HD, and not the awkward 1680x1050 resolution of the fatt TV monitor I used to use and then mutilated by the resolution requirements of YouTube into 1152x720!
</p>

<p>
You can see from the video (probably if you're watching in 1080p or even less) that the screen and webcam should be a good bit crisper since it's no longer going through that awkward conversion.
On my side, the color of the monitor is also fantastic.
Obviously you can't really see it, but it definitely makes a difference for me.

"))) ("Physiognomy is real! (A request)" "<p>
You may've heard of <em>physiognomy</em>, which is the study of how people's
physical appearances or faces relate to their psychology or personality.
Physiognomy is interesting because it was one of those many fields brushed
aside as \"pseudo-scientific\" ironically enough my the early 20th century bugman
scientists who lacked the tools to study it (and were also afraid of something
that could be perceived as wacist).  Nowadays, however, with better
experimental techniques and sometimes even the aid of artificial intelligence,
there have arisen a lot of different experimental studies finding that
physiognomy is very real as a correlation between body/facial structure and
personality, but also that people are very good at judging other peoples'
personalities from that structure.
</p>
<p>
This often trickles into the news media when we hear about faces being \"gay\" or
\"racist\". We hear about how political persuasion correlates with body strength
or religious zeal being readable from one's face.  There are more subtle
things, like a person's index to ring finger ratio that are registers of
prenatal testosterone, thus correlating with all manners of things. And then
there's left-handedness.
</p>
<p>
This shouldn't be a surprise for anyone.
The nerd and the chad have separate personalities, but their different bodies and dispositions reflect them.
One might cause the other, or be related for other reasons, but the correlations are there and everyone knows and recognizes them.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, for the podcast <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://notrelated.xyz\">NotRelated.xyz</a>, I'm planning on doing an episode on physiognomy.
Yes, I know I haven't put out an episode in around month, but I've been unable to record due to factors out of my control ;-).
I have this and two (sort of three) other episodes under construction and I think once I move to my new place January, I'll have <em>much</em> more recording time.
</p>
<p>
<b>I'm saying all this because I'm curious if people reading have any physiognomy data or even anecdotes.</b> I've compiled a lot of studies on this kind of stuff over time, but feel free to send me what you have.

"))) ("My public blog script, `lb` is now much improved" "<p>I know a couple of you guys out there use <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb\">my blog script, lb,</a> for your personal blogs.
Advertised as a \"Blog &amp; RSS system in less than 100 lines of shell script\". It's minimal, easy to customize and I've been using it for months now.
If you didn't see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIfAdzGmhik\">the original video</a>, there's the link.
</p>
<p>The script allows you to write blog posts that are then automatically syndicated in several locations of your choosing:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rolling blog page: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/blog.html\">lukesmith.xyz/blog.html</a></li>
<li>A blog index page (can be placed in your index if desired): <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/blogindex.html\">lukesmith.xyz/blogindex.html</a></li>
<li>All posts appear in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/blog\">blog/</a> directory, which can be accessible via Apache settings.</li>
<li>RSS entries, containing the full blog post are added to your RSS feed of choice (e.g. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml\">lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
But yesterday I rewrote the script, actually making it shorter while adding some nice features.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to revise already published articles</li>
<li>Smarter URL creation. The old script made somewhat dumb urls.</li>
<li>Use of the <code>.htaccess</code> file as a database to store filename-title correspondences and now publishing dates</li>
<li>In the editing mode, only the text content, not the header or footer will appear in your editor. This is a side-effect of the fact above, since before, I had used the magic of script-kiddery to read from the buffer on publishing to determine the post's title. Now it's stored in <code>.htaccess</code> so that's not necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The script is backwards compatible with the old script, although the commands have slightly changed (just run the command and it will tell you how) and if you've been working on unpublished drafts in lb 1.0, you must still publish them with lb 1.0.
This backwards compatibility means that you can also revise old published blog entries without much of a problem.
The only hiccup is the fact that if you revise a blog entry published with lb 1.0, when republished it will appear only with the new date.
This should not be true of articles published by this lb 2.0.

<p>I know a couple of you guys out there use <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb\">my blog script, lb,</a> for your personal blogs.
Advertised as a \"Blog &amp; RSS system in less than 100 lines of shell script\". It's minimal, easy to customize and I've been using it for months now.
If you didn't see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIfAdzGmhik\">the original video</a>, there's the link.
</p>

<p>The script allows you to write blog posts that are then automatically syndicated in several locations of your choosing:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A rolling blog page: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/blog.html\">lukesmith.xyz/blog.html</a></li>
	<li>A blog index page (can be placed in your index if desired): <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/blogindex.html\">lukesmith.xyz/blogindex.html</a></li>
	<li>All posts appear in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/blog\">blog/</a> directory, which can be accessible via Apache settings.</li>
	<li>RSS entries, containing the full blog post are added to your RSS feed of choice (e.g. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml\">lukesmith.xyz/rss.xml</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
But yesterday I rewrote the script, actually making it shorter while adding some nice features.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The ability to revise already published articles</li>
	<li>Smarter URL creation. The old script made somewhat dumb urls.</li>
	<li>Use of the <code>.htaccess</code> file as a database to store filename-title correspondences and now publishing dates</li>
	<li>In the editing mode, only the text content, not the header or footer will appear in your editor. This is a side-effect of the fact above, since before, I had used the magic of script-kiddery to read from the buffer on publishing to determine the post's title. Now it's stored in <code>.htaccess</code> so that's not necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The script is backwards compatible with the old script, although the commands have slightly changed (just run the command and it will tell you how) and if you've been working on unpublished drafts in lb 1.0, you must still publish them with lb 1.0.
This backwards compatibility means that you can also revise old published blog entries without much of a problem.
The only hiccup is the fact that if you revise a blog entry published with lb 1.0, when republished it will appear only with the new date.
This should not be true of articles published by this lb 2.0.
</p>

<p>To \"install\" the blog script, simply download it to the wanted blog directory and change the variables in it to seek the correct files (the RSS feed, blog file, blog index).
You must add a comment line that looks exactly like this:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- LB --&gt;</code></pre>

<p>to each file. That line is the point in the document after which new articles/RSS entries/list entries will be added.

"))) ("GDP and income is a measure of fragility" "<p>
The common way of looking at Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is that it's a metric of economic success: more GDP is more wealth.
Wealth is good. \"Poverty\" (meaning low <em>per capita</em> GDP) is bad.
Nowadays, pretty much everyone talks about \"economics\" like this as if this truism was scribbled on the back walls of the cosmos.
</p>
<p>
This is just looking at one side of the ledger in a kind of global double-entry accounting book.
A logically equivalent way of looking at it is that <b>GDP is the metric of economic exchange required for survival in society as it exists</b>.
You can say that some area \"produced\" $1B USD of output (sounds good), but you can just as easily say that $1B USD was required for that area to sustain itself (sounds bad).
These two are simply logically equivalent.
</p>
<p>
Let's dive into the Gestalt: when you hear that a family of eight lives on less than a dollar per day (PPP adjusted), you might wonder how they manage!
To <em>actually</em> do such a thing would require buying large bags of rice for the whole family, eat only that and live in free cardboard boxes.
The reality is that that often uttered phrase means that they use less than $1 a day in the general economy, while the rest of their livelihood is \"off-the-grid\" or self-sufficient.
They may grow food in a family farm, hunt for food, and most of their daily needs from cooking oils, to plates, to pottery, to soap are often made at home as well.
There is still \"an economy\" but often one that is barter based or <em>socialist</em> in the real pre-socialist sense of the word: mediated by direct face-to-face social tit-for-tat between neighbors and friends, none of this mediated by currency being exchanged, thus it is not part of the GDP.
</p>
<p>
If you read about some Bangladeshi village where the only product is \"textiles\", that doesn't mean that everyone there makes textiles all day and, without a textile company, everyone would've starved to death.
It means that the only on-paper, measurable global industry practiced there is textile manufacturing.
Other villagers might farm, hunt, even do some kind of gathering in some places.
They will produce the arts and crafts and live the way people live when you leave them alone.
If your view of the world is mediated by GDP, you're only seeing the extremely small sliver that pops into existence when people exchange something involving legal tender.
</p>
<p>
This is extremely difficult for us modern bugpeople to understand because to be a bugman in a large city is to produce absolutely nothing on one's own and buy literally everything you need from the store.
To us non-productive people, GDP means income which means survival.
But the further out of Bugmanville you go, the clearer the vacuousness of GDP becomes.
</p>
<p>
A minor example.
We had a large Thanksgiving feast near my uncle's house in very rural Florida.
As it got cold in the night, we had a fire in a repurposed old sugar cane cooking vat artfully standing on used symmetrical cinderblock pieces.
A bugman hipster might pay two hundred dollars or more for a similar looking \"authentic\" piece of equipment. Those $200 would be counted in the GDP.
A bugman hipster might have also bought or rented chairs for the event, \"contributing\" more to the GDP, but my uncle, as part of the local wholesome church community, simply borrowed some from the church.
Thus our event produced basically no GDP output in goods or services, despite being functionally equivalent to some similar but expensive and ergo \"productive\" \"Friendsgiving\" practiced by urbanites.
In reality <em>we</em> are richer than the bugmen hipsters who blew hundreds of dollars on a faux-folksy party.
In this case, we owned the firepit and had easy access and permission to the chairs, thus we are more economically flexible than they are.
That GDP that they produced/expended is evidence of deeper reliance on the economic system.
That GDP output is a marker of <em>fragility</em>, reliance on the conditions of the outside economy in the same way that a village of Bangladeshis who abandon their traditional way of lives to work on textiles are more fragile, despite being able to save up for iPhones.
</p>
<p>
Much of the increase in GDP across the world is simply the movement from local partially-social partially-under-the-table economies to economies mediated by taxable currency.
An economically self-sufficient village with close social relationships and a barter economy has 0 GDP.
A township of entrepreneurs and artisans you partially barter and partially use currency which they don't report has 0 GDP.
All of these people are \"in poverty\" and \"earn less than a dollar a day\".
And if you want to be truly self-sufficient, that means having a personal GDP of zero.
</p>
<p>
More than that, pretty much everywhere, GDP is a strong indicator of social upheaval.
If you think that GDP is some eternal goodness, remember that <em>everything \"good\" about industrialization shows up in the GDP</em>, while at the same time, <em>everything bad about it will not show up</em>.
Or, sometimes bad things are registered as positive economic growth: urbanization has caused mass-disease, and if that means a market for new medical services and pharmaceuticals, great!
The GDP just went up!
The Ganges is polluted due to the textile plant? That just means more opportunities for local entrepreneurs to sell bottled water!
The GDP just went up!
Are people being pushed out of fishing or other subsistence occupations because of it? Even better! Now they have no choice but to contribute to the GDP!
With every passing year, in fact, more and more of the GDP is produced by dealing with the problems that our higher level of GDP have caused.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, I am not saying that (a) GDP is utterly useless and means nothing nor (b) that having 0 GDP and thus everyone is totally self-sufficient in a barter economy is best.
I'm also not specifically arguing that industrialization is generally bad (I do think that, but my point here is irrelevant to it).
Simply put, I'm sick of big-braned moderates posting basic-ass comments on my videos about how \"X is good because it increases the GDP\", or worse, \"the GDP has been going up, so our ever increasing level of bugmanism is good\".
GDP is a bad justification for Whig history, and in areas of personal independence, it's not a good indicator.

Maybe you heard about it on Reddit or one of the other Content Aggregation sites you frequent.
Since you're new, let me let you in on a little secret...
You see, 4chan doesn't work like other sites.
You don't get upvotes for sharing content and no 4chan user cares about e-celebs.

You see, maybe you really like the videos I put out on YouTube.
Maybe they've really changed your life even.
That's great!
Unfortunately, it is not polite to share my videos on 4chan!
Not polite to me, nor to 4chan users!
</p>

You see, on 4chan, anonymity is paramount and e-celebrities are frowned upon.
Linking to my content unsolicited looks like an extremely cringey advertisement!
If someone specifically asks for something that I have covered, this would be an appropriate time to link to one of my videos on 4chan, albeit without fanfare or specific personal glorification of me.
However, uninvited links to my content, especially saying \"Wow look what Luke Smith did\" when no one asks is the highest form of faux pas.

<p>
Hi there! It appears you're new to 4chan.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you heard about it on Reddit or one of the other Content Aggregation sites you frequent.
Since you're new, let me let you in on a little secret...
You see, 4chan doesn't work like other sites.
You don't get upvotes for sharing content and no 4chan user cares about e-celebs.
</p>

<p>
You see, maybe you really like the videos I put out on YouTube.
Maybe they've really changed your life even.
That's great!
Unfortunately, it is not polite to share my videos on 4chan!
Not polite to me, nor to 4chan users!
</p>

<p>
You see, on 4chan, anonymity is paramount and e-celebrities are frowned upon.
Linking to my content unsolicited looks like an extremely cringey advertisement!
If someone specifically asks for something that I have covered, this would be an appropriate time to link to one of my videos on 4chan, albeit without fanfare or specific personal glorification of me.
However, uninvited links to my content, especially saying \"Wow look what Luke Smith did\" when no one asks is the highest form of faux pas.

I just put up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfOwRYmb5bQ\">a brief video</a> comparing the efficiency of formatting a document with references in LaTeX via biber vs. using groff/troff via <code>refer</code>.
</p>
<p>
Check it out yourself, but needless to say, groff gets the job done just as well in a small sliver of the time LaTeX takes.

Check it out yourself, but needless to say, groff gets the job done just as well in a small sliver of the time LaTeX takes.

"))) ("Trip up Country and Looking for Land" "<p>
This coming weekend, I'll be taking a partially-family-related-partially-personal trip up to Indiana with some crucial stops on the way.
The only complication is that I don't own a car, so my four-state trip will be mediated by bus, meaning I'll be paying much less than I would be for gas or a plane and I'll have plenty of time for uninterrupted reading and work. I've also bought a ThinkPad slice battery that I'll be picking up right before, so I can try that out as well.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, why I'm going to Indiana isn't important for you, but as many of you know, I've been in the market for land recently, and have been planning on buying a remote plot for building a large cabin or small house for a long-term home or short-term place for vacation and storage.
On my way back from my trip, I'll be stopping in Tennessee to look at some parcels.
I don't want to spend more than $20,000 for land, and I'd like to get at least 5 acres for that (ideally less and more of course).
I'm already doing the math for how much it will cost to build a house to my specifications, but a lot is going to be a function of what kind of land I can get
</p>
<p>
I've picked Tennessee because it's still relatively close to my family, but is politically and regulatorily much better than Georgia.
There's low property tax, no state income tax, relatively free homeschooling and apparently less zoning/building restrictions in most places.
Georgia on the other hand is literally a 56% state nowadays (well according to Wikipedia, 55.9% actually), which means sooner or later it will be a blue state.
Of course, even if blue in a presidential election, it would probably only be a generation later before this filters down into local elections, which realistically means over-regulation and extreme managerial state is still fairly distant. Still, since I have the choice of where to put roots down, it's an easy one. I have thought of places further north: Kentucky or West Virginia, but the proximity to Georgia is still a minor plus for me. I don't know how the situation is going to be in Tennessee by the time my children have to think about this, but I'll be working for it to be good.
</p>
<p>
I'll also enjoy the milder climate in Tennessee. I honestly just want to be where I don't need an air-conditioner for most of the year.</p>
<p>Anyway, if everything works out, there might be a house-building, property-maintenance and bushcraft portion of my channel before too long. I can't say when, but if I find something good, I might be moving into the area and renting a place while I work on my new home.

"))) ("Any Paleo-Anthropologists or geneticists reading? On the Toba Population Bottleneck" "<p>
There's an often repeated idea out there that humans went through a population bottleneck about 70,000 years ago, shrinking to a group of only several thousands. This bottleneck is typically attributed to the Toba Eruption.
This is something you've probably heard <em>ad nauseam</em> in every popular science depiction of human prehistory, I sure have.
I won't give specifics because I don't want to bias you, but in doing research for a future podcast episode, I began to doubt this idea and tried to pry into its actual origins to see what the actual evidence of it was.
</p>
<p>
I was surprised to learn that the idea didn't actually come from some scholarly consensus, but is a still very controversial idea originally posited by a journalist Ann Gibbons of <i>Science</i>.
Now anyone who knows me knows that I am the absolutely last to write off an idea or theory because it's posited by a lay(wo)man out of the academic system, but in the case of a <em>journalist</em> (that class of people whose ratios of what-they-know to what-they-think-they-know are extremely low), my initial doubt feels a little vindicated.
</p>
<p>
I've been groping through some scientific literature on the subject, there are indeed some mainstream supporters, but from what I can tell, the evidence for it is very scant, at least far too scant to warrant its commonplace presentation in popular science.
As well, it seems that a lot of people in other fields base some of their assumptions on this idea, not knowing its non-universality, thus giving their theories a shaky foundation.
</p>
<p>I bring this up because I'm curious if anyone reading has had specific, semi-direct knowledge or experience with the feeling in the field.
As I said, I'm gradually reading the literature on it already, but I'm curious to know an insider's view (or at least the view of someone well-informed on it).
Is this idea well-accepted?
Is the circumstantial evidence for it considered up to snuff?
Are there good reasons to think it's <em>not</em> true?

Originally, \"NPC\" arose as a term of abuse approximating \"normie\" or \"brainlet\", but there have been some who are realizing that it might have more truth to it than anticipated.

One might also be reminded of the quip of James Huneker on Chopin's &Eacute;tude Op. 25, Num. 11 (better known nowadays by being quoted by Douglass Hofstadter in G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach) that \"small-souled men, no matter how agile their fingers, should avoid it\".
Of course, listeners of the biggest-braned podcast <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://notrelated.xyz\">Not Related!</a> will remember in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://notrelated.xyz/the-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind\">the episode on the Bicameral Mind</a>, we talked on Julian Jaynes's theory of consciousness, in which consciousness is not something inherent to our biological inventory, but a kind of mental habit we develop, partially based on the metaphors of language and our need in society.
Different societies and cultures are liable to create different levels of consciousness in people.
</p>
<p>
There seems to be circumstantial evidence everywhere that the internal worlds of others just are not quite the same as ours.
There's a huge scientific and epistemological problem though: how can we empirically and objectively verify the nature consciousness, an aspect of mental life which is by its nature accessible only subjectively?
</p>
<p>
I dont think this question is answerable in the scientific mindset we currently have.
More interesting as a hint would be a deeper understanding, albeit indirect of what other people's inner worlds are like.
I'm sort of curious to hear what <b>your</b> inner life is like, and how you experience \"thinking\" if it's something unique.
</p>
<p>
I'll do my part and share with others my mental life.
I do have internal speech and am not an NPC and am indeed conscious.
My internal speech is a little bit different from how I hear others describe theirs.
Sometimes, usually when I'm thinking very slowly and deliberately, I think at only slightly faster than enunciated English in real life.
Most of the time, the \"speech\" is quite different: the best way I can describe the experience is as if you \"hummed\" the intonation of English to yourself without opening your mouth (this is not something I literally do, but how I experience it in my head). This mild humming occurs at a speed significantly faster than normal speech and though it provokes the same \"meaning\" and cognitive scaffolding as language does. It's not an annoying or abrasive humming, I should say: it's more like if someone is gently (though quickly) talking in the other room.
This hummed speech \"feels\" like English, but when I slow it down because it just gave me a great idea that I want to write down, I realize that there sometimes aren't actually English words or English syntax that directly capture what I was thinking.
</p>
<p>I should say, when I say that it \"feels\" like English, I mean that, as someone who knows a lot of different languages and has an intuitive grasp of etymology, I have distinct, almost synesthetic feelings that correspond to words of different origins. When I experience what linguists call \"tip of the tongue phenomena\" (when you forgot a word but can remember what it means and how it starts), I also can recall the approximate etymology. What I mean is that this humming speech has the same feeling as English words do.
</p>
<p>
I'd probably say that most of my mental time does <em>not</em> use this kind of internal speech.
It's not that I'm unconscious, but because I usually think about more abstract and non-linear things with interlocking, organic shapes.
This is a little closer to how some savants describe their mental life, but I suspect it's a lot more common than that, not just because I have it, but it seems to be the kind of thing that people would take for granted.
The typical description is that invisible shapes of different \"meanings\" come together and connect, or hydraulic organic machinery interacts in such a way to give you the correct answers to math problems or some advanced mental decision whose actual mechanism is opaque to you.
The thing is, while I experience this, it's something I'm only an observer of, and while I say that the shapes have \"meanings\", that's sort of my assumption, because if you could display my cognitive theater on a screen, I couldn't point out what is what with my conscious mind.
I think this is some kind of felt vision into the structure of intuition more than anything else.
</p>
<p>As a minor detail, I also have no cognitive \"me\". Or at least not unless I want one.
What I mean by that is that people will often describe themselves in their imaginations as seeing in the first person, or seeing themselves in third person (as if watching themselves on TV).
These are sometimes called the \"I\" and \"me\".
I can easily imagine myself, say, taking a walk and seeing myself walking from above, but that's not something I regularly do without prodding.
Whenever I imagine myself doing something, I see everything from my own eyes unless deliberately trying to do otherwise.

"))) ("Alex Jones, increasingly BASED, now even more banned from everything" "<p>Well-known and loved water-filter merchant Alex Jones was banned from Twitter, in a move that shocked no one.
After a sustained campaign of harassment from Bluechecks, Twitter finally gave in and banned him and his site <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://infowars.com\">InfoWars.com</a>, thus depriving Twitter of Super Male Vitality and other high-energy supplements.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the straw that broke the camel's back was absolutely based.
The rationalization for the ban was the fact that yesterday Alex posted videos haranguing a CNN journalist who had worked tirelessly to get him and others banned and deplatformed.
The journalist was shook to say the least, visibly timid and obviously wishing he was a turtle so he could retract his head into his shell.
After several minutes of straight roasting (peppered with some attempted \"comebacks\" from the journo), Chuck Johnson (the guy noted for being banned from Twitter back when no one got banned) joined in as well, the video later ending with a close up of the journalist's eyes, tearing up and silently distraught.
</p>
<p>
Journo-bugmen and pseudo-intellects in universities have been subjecting Americans to a non-stop humiliation-fest and struggle session since at least the 1960s.
These people are literally paid by corporations and government organizations to demean, destroy and \"deconstruct\" the lives of the people that pay their bills.
They circulate baseless folklore and conspiracy theories about non-bugmen.
They live obliviously and smugly sit and design what they want the world of others to look like.
They talk tough and snidely on news stations and in university, but as soon as you shine the light on them, they curl up in shame.
Their pretenses only exist in their isolated world where they can't be debated, made fun of, humiliated or held accountable.
They're also just dumb.
</p>
<p>Alex's unpardonable sin is subjecting one of these chosen beings, one of these Excelsites to mockery.
Alex deserves a lot of credit for making this joker tear up.

<p>Well-known and loved water-filter merchant Alex Jones was banned from Twitter, in a move that shocked no one.
After a sustained campaign of harassment from Bluechecks, Twitter finally gave in and banned him and his site <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://infowars.com\">InfoWars.com</a>, thus depriving Twitter of Super Male Vitality and other high-energy supplements.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the straw that broke the camel's back was absolutely based.
The rationalization for the ban was the fact that yesterday Alex posted videos haranguing a CNN journalist who had worked tirelessly to get him and others banned and deplatformed.
The journalist was shook to say the least, visibly timid and obviously wishing he was a turtle so he could retract his head into his shell.
After several minutes of straight roasting (peppered with some attempted \"comebacks\" from the journo), Chuck Johnson (the guy noted for being banned from Twitter back when no one got banned) joined in as well, the video later ending with a close up of the journalist's eyes, tearing up and silently distraught.
</p>

<p>
Journo-bugmen and pseudo-intellects in universities have been subjecting Americans to a non-stop humiliation-fest and struggle session since at least the 1960s.
These people are literally paid by corporations and government organizations to demean, destroy and \"deconstruct\" the lives of the people that pay their bills.
They circulate baseless folklore and conspiracy theories about non-bugmen.
They live obliviously and smugly sit and design what they want the world of others to look like.
They talk tough and snidely on news stations and in university, but as soon as you shine the light on them, they curl up in shame.
Their pretenses only exist in their isolated world where they can't be debated, made fun of, humiliated or held accountable.
They're also just dumb.
</p>

<p>Alex's unpardonable sin is subjecting one of these chosen beings, one of these Excelsites to mockery.
Alex deserves a lot of credit for making this joker tear up.
Hopefully you're going to see a lot more of it too from more people.

Identifying with some meme diet you've become rationally convinced of is like identifying by the music you listen to or some autistically-differentiated political label. It's something people only do in a bugman society when they've been deprived of their real identity.</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, I occasionally get questions about what I eat and as I go on, my functional diet changes, but interesting patterns emerge.
Nowadays you've had meme diets from Atkins to Paleo to this new keto meme; all of them circulate around the idea that the food pyramid is a lie, and meats and fats are severely underrated.
In my experience, I'm very inclined to agree.
In fact, one of the realities of nutrition \"science\" is that a lot of the jack-booting, tone-setting and \"advocacy\" has always been done by either Jehovah's Witnesses or vegetarians, two parties who have ideological motivations to downplay the good of meat and to overplay the good of \"slave foods\" like cereals and starchy staples.
I'm not bothered by their ethical pretenses, but it's a whole nother thing to pretend that they're based in the reality of what's good for humans aside from pietisms.
</p>
<p>
First, for my younger viewers, you'll realize as you get \"old\" (as you leave puberty at least around 25), your digestive abilities and metabolism change.
The young digestive system is much more plastic and durable than someone in the late 20s and on. You've probably heard that you'll put on weight more easier if you eat pizza, true for most people, but for me, I've found that it's increasingly difficult even to properly <em>digest</em> greasy pizza, junk food, sugars and everything processed and terrible about the modern world.
As you get a little older, you really can <em>feel</em> the debilitatingly negative hormonal effects of carbo-loading. You get acid-reflux and indigestion more too. Domino's is a one-way ticket to diarrhea.
Hell, a couple weeks ago in a silly attempt to put on empty weight, I bought and ate a meek-and-mild <em>Cheerios</em> knock-off and let's just say that came out looking about the same as they went in.
</p>
<p>
Don't worry, I'm not falling apart. The solution has been easy.
Stop eating processed foods. Stop eating sugar. And Stop eating the Virgin Bottom-of-the-Food-Pyramid. Just eat meat.
</p>
<p>
I don't eat <em>only</em> meat now, but I abandoned the pretense and can acknowledge that meals are nothing more than a serving of meat with some other mostly decorative foods.
I have some vegetables and fruits here and there, and I do go out to eat and get a sandwich (with bread of course) every once in a while.
I'll say that I've realized that I can detect a little digestive difference between meat treated with antibiotics and that without. Might be confirmation bias, but I prefer untreated or organic meat and will buy it if it's not too much more expensive. Typical meals include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Chicken thighs/legs covered in garlic powder, garlic salt, thyme and rosemary. 20 minutes on oiled tray in a 425F oven.</li>
<li>Steak. Rare, duh. Cooked on the range with an entire diced onion (which becomes caramelized) and about a third of a green pepper. Occasionally topped with cheese that I grate (yup, I use cheese blocks because I'm an artiste)</li>
<li>Whole chicken, decorated internally and externally with shards of onions, garlic and sometimes potatoes. Washed with egg white. Thyme, rosemary. Covered with foil and ovened for maybe 40 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh and I use olive oil for all of these. None of that Cucknola oil BS. I'm also not big on salt.</p>
<p>And by the way, stop believing Nutrition Facts autism.
The reality of nutrition \"science\" is that the body is a machine far more complex than we understand.
The idea that our body needs precisely that 100% of all of those substances that the American government proclaimed back in the 70s is ridiculous.
For the same reason, sorry, but eating something with another random protein (like le soy) isn't a substitute for the actual nourishment of meat. My scientific proof is the diminished physical and hormonal state of vegans.
Some people will tell them they need B12 or something else, but it's far beyond that.
Regardless \"diet\" foods/sodas are the same. They only exist so they look good on the nutrition facts. They produce equivalent tastes and fill your stomach with things that you're body can't digest and turn into calories/energy. In a sane society, that would be identified as being something way worse than the thing they're supposed to be replacing.

"))) ("Macs, \"PCs\" and the Power of Public Relations" "<p>One of the strangest turns-of-phrase that Apple has tried to hoist on the public is the term \"PC\" to mean all non-Apple computers.
Even without delving much deeper, this is one of the most bizarre choices; Apple Mac computers are not just PCs, but they were arguably <em>the first</em> PCs&mdash;you would think that Apple would be proud of more or less inventing the idea of a Personal Computer.</p>
<p>Regardless, what is the <em>point</em> of the term PC to Apple advertising? Why did they run that classic series of commercials contrasting Macs and \"PCs\"?
At a basic level, PC is just a catch-all exonym, that is, a term for all computers outside of a designated group.
In reality, there's really nothing common to computers made by Lenovo, Dell, Asus and every other company that aren't also held in common with Apple computers.
The only thing in common, at least, is the <em>lack</em> of the characteristic Apple weirdness (no other company is going to get rid of all their computers' important ports, for example).</p>
<p>Regardless, I noticed the actual public relations use of the term \"PC\" after I did my video on Macs&mdash;this term works wonders in the mind of an Mac fan.
That is, nearly every dogmatic Apple user would call me a \"PC fanboy\"!
<em>PC fanboy...</em> what could that possibly mean?</p>
<p>At first I thought most hate mail was coming from people who didn't watch 10 or so seconds in when I said that I used Linux (deliberately to avoid inane comments like this).
I assumed that \"PC\" meant \"a machine running Windows\", which is clearly not what Mac-users thought the term to mean: it was <em>all</em> non-Mac computers. I'd guess that my old TI-84 calculator is a \"PC\" by that metric.
This is a total inversion of what the term \"fanboy\" means of course. You can be a Mac fanboy: Apple Mac products, while sometimes different, all share the exact same design principles and are all owned by one company notorious for its quasi-cult like public relations.</p>
<p>While on the other hand, \"PC fanboy\" doesn't really mean anything&mdash;there's no common denominator or design or principle behind all non-Apple computers (again, aside from the fact that they don't do the manifestly stupid things that Apple does).
A \"PC fanboy\" in practice just means someone who doesn't like Macs, but that's where the magic is for Apple advertising&mdash;Mac users have always been lampooned as cult members, but the term PC is an attempt redirect the claims of irrational devotion backwards.
It doesn't have to make sense generally, but it makes sense in the head of an Apple fanboy: non-Mac computers are all the same and if you don't like Macs, you must just have some terrible emotional problem with them for no reason (this is the gist of most of the hatemail I get on this anyway).</p>
<p>Since I made my video on Macs, I don't dislike Macs any more than I did before, but I am continually losing respect for Mac users.
I could've just as easily done a video on why I don't use Windows, but God knows that Windows users don't have the same genre of pathological attachment to the brand they use.
That's not to imply that all comments from Mac users even disagreed with me, but the vocal members of the hivemind have certainly put a smug anime girl face on me from time to time.

I don't have the slightest idea how much money I'll actually end up getting from this, but I hope it's decent enough.

<p>
Of course, my studious core of viewers all will be using ad-blockers. The one I usually recommend is <a href=\"https://adnauseam.io/\">Ad Nauseam</a>, which is not just a blocker, but a dazzler. If you don't like ads, don't feel like you need to permit them from my channel to get me more revenue. I'm sure there are plenty other who will be watching them without.
I only monetized after polling my audience at the old forum (some 80% just told me to monetize) and if you're part of that remaining 20%, just block them as you usually would.
</p>

<p>I took a long (several hour) walk to clear my head this morning, and came back to a pleasant surprise: YouTube has finally (after five or six months of review) monetized my channel.
I don't have the slightest idea how much money I'll actually end up getting from this, but I hope it's decent enough.
</p>

<p>
Of course, my studious core of viewers all will be using ad-blockers. The one I usually recommend is <a href=\"https://adnauseam.io/\">Ad Nauseam</a>, which is not just a blocker, but a dazzler. If you don't like ads, don't feel like you need to permit them from my channel to get me more revenue. I'm sure there are plenty other who will be watching them without.
I only monetized after polling my audience at the old forum (some 80% just told me to monetize) and if you're part of that remaining 20%, just block them as you usually would.

After a full day and after seeing about a dozen places, I have to admit that I didn't find anywhere too much up to snuff, even given the fact that I don't need to be particularly close to the university.</p>
<p>I may be back there again within a week or so, but I'll concede that I was debating whether I actually want to live there again.
I'm really not in the mood to put down a year's rent anywhere, even if it's only $5000 or so, unless I can get a really great place, but I suppose the real problem is a change in my mindset.</p>
<p>In brief, I don't feel like I want to put down money for something that isn't going to last; the bugmanhood of renting an apartment is extremely unappealing.
The better alternative now seems like just buying a parcel of land with the little money I've saved up.
My goal is 5+ semi-remote acres for less than $20,000, which is doable. I have a couple placing I'm looking at now, but am always looking for more.
I just want land that I am extremely free in building restrictions and zoning (preferable none), and that I can have a permanent setup on: possible growing and self-sustaining utilities.
I've done a lot of math and think that I can get a decent cabin built (my myself) for less than $5,000, probably closer to $3,000, but maybe with $2,000 of unforeseen costs ;-)</p>
<p>The other thing on the ledger would be me buying a car (or more likely, a pick-up) because I haven't needed a car since honestly 10 years (my old car finally died about two years ago).
Granted, if anyone reading this around Georgia has a used pickup truck in good shape they're willing to get rid of, feel free to contact me ;-)

<li>There actually were some girls Linuxfest (although no obvious <font color=\"green\">&gt;girls</font>).</li>
<li>My talk was pretty crowded; standing room only. It also generated a lot of good discussion. I polled the audience and about half of them knew me (usually the younger ones).</li>

<li>I even had a very young fan (as in utterly prepubescent fan) besting even Pewdiepie's fans in youth. He asked for an autograph and picture.</li>
<li>Linuxfest was generally well-organized but there were some huge oversights. The rooms were only equipped to handle HDMI inputs. This basically ruined Michael Tunnell's presentation which was right before mine (and probably others) since they couldn't record from his laptop. Poor guy had to use some useless Chromebook (which its distinct lack of keys) to try to preview kdenlive.

<p>I've been at Southeast Linuxfest the past two days. I'll probably do a full review later, but here are some highlights so far.</p>

<ul>
<li>My subscribers are not nearly as weird as I anticipated, and seem to be actually less weird than the average Linux user.</li>
<li>There actually were some girls Linuxfest (although no obvious <font color=\"green\">&gt;girls</font>).</li>
<li>My talk was pretty crowded; standing room only. It also generated a lot of good discussion. I polled the audience and about half of them knew me (usually the younger ones).</li>
<li>Some boomer guy began to unironically \"Interject\" to my use of the term \"Linux\" as I used it in the talk ;-)</li>
<li>I even had a very young fan (as in utterly prepubescent fan) besting even Pewdiepie's fans in youth. He asked for an autograph and picture.</li>
<li>Linuxfest was generally well-organized but there were some huge oversights. The rooms were only equipped to handle HDMI inputs. This basically ruined Michael Tunnell's presentation which was right before mine (and probably others) since they couldn't record from his laptop. Poor guy had to use some useless Chromebook (which its distinct lack of keys) to try to preview kdenlive. They couldn't record from mine either, but I'm not going to let that happen, so I just went Harambe Mindframe and connected to the screen VGA input, bypassing their recording rig and recorded the talk on my own machine.

<ul>
<li>Just go full innawoods right now, buy land (in Georgia or Tennessee) with my money and get started. The disadvantage is that I don't have as much money as I'd like to get a choice parcel, and this would also interfere with my dissertation (perhaps it doesn't matter of course).</li>
<li>Partial innawoods. I have some family in Florida with remote land and farmhouses. I could ask to live their and watch the property, maybe practice for real innawoods hours in the meantime. No money required other than my food, unless the relevant family member wants nominal rent.</li>
<li>Move to an apartment in a practical place to work on my dissertation. This would probably mean a college town where they have a library and bus system (probably Athens, where the University of Georgia is, where I've lived before and have friends, but I don't particularly like the place).

<li>Move into Atlanta, get an internship at an NGO, become a bugman (joke choice).</li>

<li>I don't own a car anymore and don't want to buy one unless I go innawoods. I'll need a truck if I do. Having a car while living in a city is a waste.</li>
<li>I'll <em>possibly</em> still be getting some amount of money from the University of Arizona for online work. This means that I'll have an income stream. I want to treat this income as going directly into the innawoods fund though.</li>
<li>If I actually ever get monetized (it's been 5 months of \"review\"), I might actually be making workable money on YouTube (possibly enough for rent somewhere). Patreon/Paypal is small now, but a lot more than nothing and sort of pays for my groceries and such.</li>

<p>That's not to say that my ascendancy in the field is even probable if I do stay, but the mere fact there's greater than a 2% chance of it would certainly have surprised me 15, 10, 5 or even 2 years ago. The only question is what aspects of my life am I willing to give up to continue to stoke the fires of this potentiality, or if I can continue to tolerate this lifestyle. On one hand, I've put up with every lie, manipulation, character assassination and \"technicality\" that could be thrown at me from this department, mostly without flinching, and my detractors are starting to sound like boys-who-cried-wolfs. On the other hand, a cabin for my family in the woods generally sounds like a better lifestyle.</p>
